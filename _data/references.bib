This paper proposes that operations are linearly ordered on an essentially constituent by constituent basis. A universal constraint on the ordering of operations in language is proposed whose function is to fix the order in which operations apply. This constraint is deployed using a generalized prohibition against improper movement. The proposal captures some but not all effects of what has traditionally been called the freezing principle. It is argued that empirically exactly the right cut is made. It is further argued that the proposal rules out an entire class of remnant movement derivations, including the analysis of cross-serial dependencies in Nilsen (2003) and the analysis of order-preservation in Koopman and Szabolcsi (2000).},

(i) We show that for every structure that violates the LCA, there is an LCA-compatible counterpart, including rightward movement structures and structures with rightward specifiers. (ii) We discuss Cinque's (2005) LCA-based analysis of word order in the extended nominal projection, demonstrating that the data in fact do not support any hypothesis stronger than a ban on rightward movement. (iii) We demonstrate that claims to the effect that central properties of phrase structure (such as headedness and the single-specifier restriction) follow from the LCA are incorrect.

We therefore hypothesized that human languages signal emotions via individual phonemes (emotional sound symbolism), and more specifically that the phonemes at the beginning of the word signal its valence, as this would maximize the receiver's time to respond adaptively. Analyzing approximately 37,000 words across five different languages (English, Spanish, Dutch, German, and Polish), we found emotional sound symbolism in all five languages, and within each language the first phoneme of a word predicted its valence better than subsequent phonemes. Moreover, given that averting danger is more urgent than acquiring rewards, we further hypothesized and demonstrated that phonemes that are uttered most rapidly tend to convey negativity rather than positivity. Thus, emotional sound symbolism is an adaptation providing an early warning system in human languages, analogous to other species' alarm calls.},

Empirically, the paper discusses the typologically rare double-oblique pattern, along with a novel way of splitting the oblique. On the basis of the syntactic behavior of oblique-bearing arguments, the paper argues that the term `oblique' corresponds to distinct cases, ranging from structural accusative case to nonstructural dative case and ergative case. Oblique number agreement is case-sensitive, targeting only ergative-oblique out of the oblique cases. In order to capture the facts, I adopt a Multiple Agree account (Hiraiwa 2005), in which partial number agreement is a process that takes place in the morphology via Impoverishment, and not in the syntax proper.},

In this book, we argue for an approach in which case labels ('Nominative', 'Ergative', etc.) are shorthand for bundles of decomposed features (cp. Halle and Vaux (1998), who do this for morphological realization), and maintain that the feature set is available not just in morphology but crucially in syntax as well. A key idea in the approach is what we call Case Targeting: the idea that probes may target arguments with specific case features. Importantly, syntax and morphology can target these features differentially, leading to various interesting mismatches. This includes allowing Clitic Movement in syntax to produce both morphophonological clitic and agreement affix on the PF side. Conversely, Agreement operation in syntax can produce morphophonological clitic and agreement affix on the PF side. We focus primarily on Sorani Kurdish varieties (Iranian languages), but also investigate and apply our approach to other Iranian languages (Kurmanji, Zazaki, Laki, Persian, Rushani, Shughni), Indo-Aryan (Hindi, Nepali, Gujarati, Maithili), Semitic (Arabic, Neo-Aramaic), and Polynesian (Nukuoro). Although we don't argue for a specific case assignment mechanism, we elaborate on various imports including for implicational hierarchies, case containment etc. We maintain that discussions of inherent vs dependent case approaches should be done at a finer granularity, one that is informed by the representation of case features that we argue for.

The two non-active Voices are the morphological realization of two distinct syntactic Voice heads generating middle and passive clauses respectively. The former are cross-linguistically interpreted as (i) anticausative, (ii) reflexive (and reciprocal), (iii) dispositional middle, and (iv) medio-passive, which is distinct from passive. This variation in the interpretation of the middle Voice reflects different properties of the root rather than the application of four different lexical rules postulated by lexicalist theories.},

The paper discusses the behavior of dispositional middles and reflexives in languages such as English as opposed to their Greek counterparts. I will pursue the hypothesis that there are three Voice related heads implicated in AS alternations across languages. Active Voice is involved in the structure of all transitive and unergative predicates across languages, which in English subsumes d. middles and reflexives. Passive Voice, which the paper will only briefly touch upon here, takes as an input a transitive structure and gives an English/German/ Hebrew type passive. Middle Voice is the non-active counterpart of Kratzer's active Voice and gives rise to reflexives, passives and dispositional middles in Greek type languages.},

In the last 50 years of research into the division of labour between the mental lexicon and syntax, the specific properties of nominalized structures have remained a particularly central question. The chapters in this volume take stock of developments in this area and offer new perspectives on a range of issues, including the representation of morphological complexity in the syntax, the correlation of nominal affixes with different types of nominalizations, and the modelling of non-compositional meaning within syntactic approaches to word formation. Crucially, the contributors base their analyses on data from typologically diverse languages, such as Archi, Greek, Hiaki, Icelandic, Mebengokre, Turkish, and Udmurt, and explore the question of whether, cross-linguistically, nominalizations have a uniform core to their structure that can be syntactically described},

  abstract = {This paper considers the Hindi --yaa and the Russian --yva, which share many properties that are characteristic of so-called neutral aspect---an aspect whose meaning generalizes across the perfective and imperfective. Proponents of neutral aspect assume that (im)perfectivity is defined in terms of reference to an event's completion. This paper refines this idea, distinguishing between an event that culminated and one that ceased to develop further. The latter notion comes from Landman's (1992) analysis of the progressive, which denotes a function from a set of events in the extension of the VP that it combines with to a set of event stages that develop into VP-events according to a particular recipe. Building on Landman's analysis, I propose that a perfective operator is one that requires a maximal stage of a VP-event; an imperfective operator is one that requires a VP-event stage, but this stage need not be maximal. I show how this analysis allows us to analyze the Hindi --yaa and the Russian --yva as being perfective and imperfective respectively, without any reference to neutrality.},

Lebanese Arabic distinguishes between true resumption, where a pronoun or an epithet phrase is related to an A{\textasciimacron} -antecedent via Bind, and apparent resumption, where the pronoun or the epithet phrase is related to its A{\textasciimacron} -antecedent via Move. Only apparent resumption displays reconstruction effects for scope and binding. As resumptives, strong pronouns and epithet phrases cannot be related to a quantificational antecedent unless they occur inside islands. We account for this Obviation Requirement as follows: (a) (true) resumption is a last resort device, (b) strong pronouns and epithet phrases in apparent resumption contexts are generated as appositive modifiers of a DP, which is fronted to an A{\textasciimacron} -position, and (c) appositive modifiers are interpreted as independent clauses. Obviation is reduced to the inability of quantifiers to bind a pronominal element across sentential boundaries.},

Here, using three Electroencephalogram (EEG)-based measures of brain activity, we establish that preverbal 11-month-old infants are sensitive to the non-arbitrary correspondences between language sounds and concepts, that is, to sound symbolism. In each trial, infant participants were presented with a visual stimulus (e.g., a round shape) followed by a novel spoken word that either sound-symbolically matched (``moma'') or mismatched (``kipi'') the shape. Amplitude increase in the gamma band showed perceptual integration of visual and auditory stimuli in the match condition within 300 msec of word onset. Furthermore, phase synchronization between electrodes at around 400 msec revealed intensified large-scale, left-hemispheric communication between brain regions in the mismatch condition as compared to the match condition, indicating heightened processing effort when integration was more demanding. Finally, event-related brain potentials showed an increased adult-like N400 response e an index of semantic integration difficulty e in the mismatch as compared to the match condition. Together, these findings suggest that 11-month-old infants spontaneously map auditory language onto visual experience by recruiting a cross-modal perceptual processing system and a nascent semantic network within the first year of life.},

  abstract = {The evidence reviewed above suggests that infants in the second year of life can already attribute false beliefs to others (see Boxes 2 and 3 for alternative interpretations). This ability is quite robust: it can be demonstrated with different spontaneous-response tasks, with various beliefinducing situations, and with human and non-human agents. Moreover, infants recognize that an agent can hold a false belief about an object's location because: (i) it is moved to another hiding location in the agent's absence or (ii) it is hidden in the agent's absence and misleading perceptual or contextual cues cause the agent to incorrectly infer its likely location. Finally, infants can attribute to an agent a complex set of mental states that includes multiple false beliefs. To illustrate, consider once again the skunk condition of Song and Baillargeon [21]. To respond correctly in the test trial, the infants had to reason that the agent had a particular disposition, a preference for the skunk over the doll, which would lead her to form the goal of obtaining the skunk. The infants also had to consider the agent's knowledge about the scene: they had to attribute to the agent not only the ability to notice the boxes and tuft of hair, but also to correctly infer that the doll and skunk were both present, as in the preceding trials, and hidden in the boxes. Finally, the infants had to reason that the agent's false perception of the tuft of hair as a part of the doll would lead her to hold false beliefs about the locations of the doll and skunk.},

  abstract = {Two distinct ideas about how morphological case is assigned exist in the recent generative literature: the standard Chomskyan view that case is assigned by designated functional heads to the closest NP via an agreement relationship, and an alternative view in which case is assigned to one NP if there is a second NP in the same local domain (Marantz 1991). We claim that these two ways of assigning case are complementary, based on data from the Turkic language Sakha. Accusative case and dative case in this language are assigned by Marantz-style configurational rules that do not refer directly to functional categories. This is shown by evidence from passives, agentive nominalizations, subject raising, possessor raising, and case assignment in PPs. In contrast, there is evidence that nominative and genitive are assigned by functional heads in the Chomskyan way, as shown by the distribution of nominative case and the relationship between case marking and agreement. The two methods of case assignment thus coexist, not only in Universal Grammar, but even in the grammar of a single language.},

  abstract = {This article investigates aspects of complementation in the Turkic language Sakha (Yakut). Some embedded clauses in this language seem ``more nominalized'' than others. In particular, I compare the syntax of clauses built around a participial verb to the syntax of finite clauses and gerundive nominals. Participial clauses pattern with ``less nominal'' finite clauses with respect to the distribution of negative polarity items, in allowing scrambling, in allowing raising to object, and in the ability to function as indirect questions. In contrast, they pattern with ``more nominal'' gerundive nominals in details of their external distribution, in being active for case assignment, and in being islands for extraction in relative clauses. Finally, participial clauses are different from both finite clauses and gerundive nominals in being able to enter into relations of obligatory control. I show that this rather complex pattern can be derived from a simple difference as to which head in a minimally elaborated clause structure is nominal in each construction---``nominal'' being understood as a category with a referential index but no specifier. The investigation leads to a refinement of my Reference-Predication Constraint, which divides up into two more specific conditions.},

This accounts for the apparent underapplication of ergative case marking with ditransitives, reciprocals, and dyadic experiencer verbs, as opposed to the applicatives of unaccusative verbs, which do have ergative subjects. Finally, I show how case assignment interacts with restructuring to explain constructions in which ergative case appears to be optional.},

First we present instances in which a nonagent receives ergative case when there is another NP nearby, in applicative constructions in Shipibo, Kalaallisut (West Greenlandic), and Chukchi. Conversely, we present instances in which an agent fails to receive ergative, either because the second NP has been rendered invisible, or because the clause is subsumed within a larger case domain (ECM, causatives). Both data sets support the DCT over the ICT. Finally, we argue that no known language displays a straightforwardly active case pattern---a fact that can be explained by the DCT but not the ICT.},

  abstract = {Controversy and uncertainty have plagued the question of whether ``object markers'' (OMs) are object pronouns cliticized to the verb or realizations of object agreement. Using data from Amharic, we address this question from a new perspective. Specifically, we claim that Amharic OMs should be analyzed as clitics because they are unable to double nominals that are quantified, anaphoric, or contain a variable bound by a quantifier. These restrictions can be derived from familiar principles of grammar---the Weak Crossover condition and the Binding theory---if and only if the OM is taken to be a pronoun (D) adjoined to v at LF. We then explain in terms of syntactic structure why these OMs can double even nonreferential DPs in experiencer subject constructions, whereas they cannot double theme arguments in unaccusatives or passives. Finally, we consider whether our analysis provides a diagnostic that distinguishes pronominal clitics from agreement morphemes across languages. OMs in Greek, Bulgarian, and Spanish seem to work broadly like Amharic, confirming that they are pronominal clitics. In contrast, OMs in Burushaski and Sambaa behave like agreement, even though certain other putative diagnostics suggest they might be clitics. We thus confirm that both object clitics and object agreement exist.},

  abstract = {Dan, a Mandean language of the Ivory Coast, marks the alienable possessors of simple nouns differently from inalienable possessors: only the former occur with the particle ɓa. This difference also shows up in nominalizations. When a verb is nominalized, its theme argument is expressed like the possessor of an inalienably possessed noun, without ɓa, whereas when an adjective is nominalized, its theme argument is expressed like the possessor of an alienably possessed noun, with ɓa. We show that this generalization holds for both a lexical type of nominalization, in which the nominalizer combines directly with the root before that root combines with any arguments, and for a syntactic type of nominalization, in which the nominalizer combines with a larger phrase. We account for this difference between deverbal nominalization and deadjectival nominalization using Baker's (2003) theory of the lexical categories, according to which verbs intrinsically combine directly with a theme argument, whereas adjectives do not, but only become predicates of a theme argument with the help of a functional head like Pred. We also show that Baker's category theory correctly predicts that denominal nouns like `childhood' pattern with deadjectival nominalizations in this respect. This study thus provides new empirical support for this particular theory of lexical categories, as opposed to ones which assume a stronger parallelism across the various lexical categories.},

  pages = {17},
  abstract = {Inspired by Partee (2010), this paper defends a broad thesis that all modifiers, including numeral modifiers, are restrictive in the sense that they can only restrict the denotation of the NP or VP they modify. However, the paper concentrates more narrowly on numeral modification, demonstrating that the evidence that motivated Ionin \& Matushansky (2006) to assign non-restrictive, privative interpretations to numerals -- assigning them functions that map singular sets to sets containing groups -- is in fact consistent with restrictive modification. Ionin \& Matushansky's (2006) argument for this type of interpretation is partly based on the distribution of Turkish numerals which exclusively combine with singular bare nouns. Section 2 demonstrates that Turkish singular bare nouns are not semantically singular, but rather are unspecified for number. Western Armenian has similar characteristics. Building on some of the observations in section 2, section 3 demonstrates that restrictive modification can account for three different types of languages with respect to the distribution of numerals and plural nouns: (i) languages where numerals exclusively combine with plural nouns (e.g., English), (ii) languages where they exclusively combine with singular bare nouns (e.g., Turkish), (iii) languages where they optionally combine with either type of noun (e.g., Western Armenian). Accounting for these differences crucially involves making a distinction between two kinds of restrictive modification among the numerals: subsective vs. intersective modification. Section 3 also discusses why privative interpretations of numerals have trouble accounting for these different language types.},

Dependent case theory, in its strongest form, holds that morphological case is never assigned by functional heads but always based on the syntactic configuration of a predicate's arguments. This contribution investigates certain phenomena such as transitivity-sensitive case in Romance causatives and global case splits, which challenge the strongest interpretation of dependent case. In both Romance causatives and global case splits, the structural configuration of the predicate's nominal arguments does not suffice to explain morphological case marking patterns. Rather, both phenomena are better modelled as consequences of Agree relations between functional heads and the relevant arguments.},

The two sets of languages show a correlation between the occurrence of null arguments and the availability of a bare nominal in argument position. I suggest that the null element is a default, minimally specified nominal---the same item that arguably appears as a complement of D in pronouns. It is a proform that minimally consists of the categorizing head n, lacking a root, the meaning of which is `entity' (a property that is trivially true of any individual in the domain). nP introduces a variable that may be bound under Existential Closure, yielding the impersonal interpretation; otherwise, its denotation is type-shifted to an individual (ɩ) under the appropriate conditions. The crosslinguistic differences found in the interpretation of the null subject depend on the resources available in particular languages for application of ɩ type-shifting: the (bare NP) languages that lack such resources only have quasi-argumental and impersonal null subjects (semi pro-drop languages). Finally, I show that the idea that pro reduces to [nP e] can also be successfully extended to the consistent NSLs, provided it is assumed that, in this type of NSL, the head bearing agreement morphology bears a D-feature and interpretable {$\phi$}-features.},

  abstract = {When faced with a sentence like, ``Some of the toys are on the table'', adults, but not preschoolers, compute a scalar implicature, taking the sentence to imply that not all the toys are on the table. This paper explores the hypothesis that children fail to compute scalar implicatures because they lack knowledge of relevant scalar alternatives to words like ``some''. Four-year-olds were shown pictures in which three out of three objects fit a description (e.g., three animals reading), and were asked to evaluate statements that relied on context-independent alternatives (e.g., knowing that all is an alternative to some for the utterance ``Some of the animals are reading'') or contextual alternatives (e.g., knowing that the set of all three visible animals is an alternative to a set of two for the utterance ``Only the cat and the dog are reading''). Children failed to reject the false statements containing context-independent scales even when the word only was used (e.g., only some), but correctly rejected equivalent statements containing contextual alternatives (e.g., only the cat and dog). These results support the hypothesis that children's difficulties with scalar implicature are due to a failure to generate relevant alternatives for specific scales. Consequences for number word learning are also discussed.},

However, many researchers do not seem to appreciate how random effects structures affect the generalizability of an analysis. Here, we argue that researchers using LMEMs for confirmatory hypothesis testing should minimally adhere to the standards that have been in place for many decades. Through theoretical arguments and Monte Carlo simulation, we show that LMEMs generalize best when they include the maximal random effects structure justified by the design. The generalization performance of LMEMs including data-driven random effects structures strongly depends upon modeling criteria and sample size, yielding reasonable results on moderately-sized samples when conservative criteria are used, but with little or no power advantage over maximal models. Finally, random-intercepts-only LMEMs used on within-subjects and/or within-items data from populations where subjects and/or items vary in their sensitivity to experimental manipulations always generalize worse than separate F1 and F2 tests, and in many cases, even worse than F1 alone. Maximal LMEMs should be the `gold standard' for confirmatory hypothesis testing in psycholinguistics and beyond.},

As for most model-fitting functions in R, the model is described in an lmer call by a formula, in this case including both fixed- and random-effects terms. The formula and data together determine a numerical representation of the model from which the profiled deviance or the profiled REML criterion can be evaluated as a function of some of the model parameters. The appropriate criterion is optimized, using one of the constrained optimization functions in R, to provide the parameter estimates. We describe the structure of the model, the steps in evaluating the profiled deviance or REML criterion, and the structure of classes or types that represents such a model. Sufficient detail is included to allow specialization of these structures by users who wish to write functions to fit specialized linear mixed models, such as models incorporating pedigrees or smoothing splines, that are not easily expressible in the formula language used by lmer.},

Recently, Barr, Levy, Scheepers, and Tily 2013 recommended fitting `maximal' models with all possible random effect components included. Estimation of maximal models, however, may not converge. We show that failure to converge typically is not due to a suboptimal estimation algorithm, but is a consequence of attempting to fit a model that is too complex to be properly supported by the data, irrespective of whether estimation is based on maximum likelihood or on Bayesian hierarchical modeling with uninformative or weakly informative priors. Importantly, even under convergence, overparameterization may lead to uninterpretable models. We provide diagnostic tools for detecting overparameterization and guiding model simplification.},

However, the agglutinative Turkic languages do not have gender. Moreover, Uzbek, a Turkic language of Central Asia, requires that nouns be specified in order to be counted, and, just like Mandarin or Thai (and other typical "classifier" languages) and Russian or English (and other typical "gender" or "nonclassifier" languages), it has several different grammatically motivated strategies, including classifying specifiers, for accomplishing the specification. It is shown that Uzbek does have classifiers and, accordingly, constitutes a counterexample to Dixon's model.},

  abstract = {In this paper we investigate cross-linguistic variation in the morphosyntax of copular clauses, focusing on agreement patterns in binominal structures [NP1 BE NP2]. Our starting point is the alternation between NP1 and NP2 agreement, which arises both within and across languages. This alternation is typically taken to be confined to specificational (i.e. inverted) clauses, and previous analyses have strongly identified NP2 agreement with the syntax of inversion. However, we show that NP2 agreement is attested in a broader range of contexts, specifically in (assumed identity) equative structures, suggesting that it should not be correlated with specificational syntax. We present contrasting data from two languages -- Persian and Eastern Armenian -- for which the syntax of copular clauses is understudied. Whereas in Persian we see NP2 agreement in specificational structures but NP1 agreement in assumed identity equatives, in Eastern Armenian both types of structure yield NP2 agreement. We argue that the contrast between Persian and Eastern Armenian supports an approach that takes the NP1--NP2 alternation to arise as a phi-sensitivity in the probe--goal mechanics of Agree in a minimalist framework. Under this view, NP2 agreement is independent of syntactic inversion and is the result of the probe structure being articulated in such a way that certain NPs fail to Agree.},

It also argues that the Yaghnobi system is similar, with a copula for existence and possession and two copulas for identification, attribution, and location. This paper suggests that the innovated Sogdian forms resulted from the combination of pronouns with the existential verb, with a possible distinction in their syntax based on the deixis of the copularizing pronouns. Finally, it shows that the large number of copula forms in Sogdian result from the re-analysis of the copulas as verbal stems.},

Candidates for such invariances include the structure dependence of grammatical rules, and in particular, certain constraints on question formation. Various ``poverty of stimulus'' (POS) arguments suggest that these invariances reflect an innate human endowment, as opposed to common experience: Such experience warrants selection of the grammars acquired only if humans assume, a priori, that selectable grammars respect substantive constraints. Recently, several researchers have tried to rebut these POS arguments. In response, we illustrate why POS arguments remain an important source of support for appeal to a priori structure-dependent constraints on the grammars that humans naturally acquire.},

  abstract = {This dissertation investigates the distribution and interpretation of covert modality. Three environments where covert modality appears are analyzed. These environments are infinitival relative clauses, infinitival questions, and ability modals. Infinitival relative clauses are shown to not form a unified class structurally. Subject infinitival relative clauses are assimilated to the class of reduced relative clauses. They lack a CP projection. Non-subject infinitival relative are assimilated to the class of full relative clauses. Like full relatives, they have a CP projection. The infinitival [+wh] C0 is argued to be the source of the modality in a non-subject infinitival relative clause. All non-subject infinitival relative clauses and infinitival questions involve modality because of the obligatory presence of the infinitival [+wh] C 0. Since subject infinitival relative clauses do not involve the infinitival [+wh] C0, they are not necessarily modal. If they are modal, the source of the modality lies within the infinitival clause. The conditions under which a subject infinitival relative can receive a non-modal interpretation are analyzed. It is shown that a non-modal interpretation must be licensed and that only a limited class of modifiers (superlatives, ordinals, and only) in a particular configuration can license the non-modal interpretation. The licensing configuration obtains under reconstruction of the head NP of the relative clause. The basic result regarding the modality in infinitival questions is that despite the apparent variability in the nature (deontic vs. circumstantial) and the force of this modality, we really have just one modality. The apparent variation in force and nature falls out from the interaction between the semantics of the infinitival [+wh] C0 and contextual factors. The apparent variation in the force and nature of the infinitival question modality is also found in non-subject infinitival relative clauses. The proposal for capturing variable modality effects in infinitival questions is extended to non-subject infinitival relatives. A covert modal (the Generic operator) is responsible for the modality in an ability modal. The ability modal itself has the semantics of an implicative verb like manage.},

Long Distance Agreement involves a verb agreeing with a constituent inside the verb's clausal complement. Long Distance Agreement and Object Agreement in Hindi-Urdu are shown to involve the same structural configurations. They both involve a head (T0) agreeing with an argument whose case-features T0 does not value. In particular, it is argued the operation Agree of Chomsky (1998, 1999, 2001) needs to be reformulated to be able to handle the facts of Hindi-Urdu Long Distance Agreement. The analysis is largely motivated on the basis of evidence from Hindi-Urdu but is shown to extend to the Long Distance Agreement facts of Tsez (Polinsky and Potsdam 2001) and Kashmiri (Subbarao and Munshi 2000).},

The existence of genuine passives in Persian has been a controversial issue, with some previous studies (e.g., Moyne 1974 and Vahedi-Langrudi 1996) arguing against the existence of syntactic or lexical passives in Persian. The current paper proposes that morphological passives in Persian formed with past participle of a verb plus shodan `to become' pattern with canonical passives cross-linguistically, and constructions involving complex predicates with a non-verbal element plus shodan `to become' are ambiguous between passives and unaccusatives. The paper then examines non-agentive complex predicates involving light verbs other than shodan `to become' and argues that while a subset of these predicates have a natural passive interpretation, they pattern with unaccusatives. Accordingly, the paper proposes voice-split structures for the verbal domain of Persian, contra the analysis in Harley 2017.},

In relation to Factor 3, I highlight a specific cognitive bias that appears well motivated outside of language, while also having wide-ranging consequences for our understanding of how I-language grammars are constructed, and why they should have the crosslinguistically comparable form that generativists have always argued human languages have. This is Maximise Minimal Means (MMM). I demonstrate how its incorporation into our model of grammar acquisition facilitates understanding of diverse facts about natural language typology, acquisition, both in ``stable'' and ``unstable'' contexts, and also the ways in which linguistic systems may change over time.},

English get-passives, analyzed in much previous work as differing thematically from be-passives, provide an interesting test case. We present an analysis of get-passives centered on the proposal that they contain additional event structure (realized as get) relative to their be counterparts. We employ by-adjuncts to identify the different event structures in passive types, and use other diagnostics to support our analysis. Further discussion considers the prominent proposal from previous studies that get-passives differ thematically from be-passives in (sometimes) assigning an Agent role to their surface subjects. We show that contrasts between get and be on this dimension are a consequence of event-structural differences between the two. The result is a unified analysis of the get-passive that has implications for the role of event structure in understanding the syntax and interpretation of arguments.},

The complex Case and agreement systems of both languages are fully accounted for, and it is shown that the proposed structures further explain other structure-sensitive phenomena (minimal scope options, obviation, and A{$\prime$}-control).

The reclassification of these constructions highlights a typological contrast between two types of verbal diathesis and clarifies the status of putative `passives of unaccusatives' and `transitive passives' in Balto-Finnic and Balto-Slavic. Impersonal verb forms differ from passives in two key respects: they are insensitive to the argument structure of a verb and can be formed from unergatives or unaccusatives, and they may retain direct objects. As with other subjectless forms of personal verbs, there is a strong tendency to interpret the suppressed subject of an impersonal as an indefinite human agent. Hence impersonalization is often felicitous only for verbs that select human subjects.},

The main argument of this thesis is that the bare noun is unique as compared to all other types of noun phrases in Turkish. As the following sections will illustrate, it is the only NP that is not specified for number, and it is the only NP that is obligatorily non-specific. I hypothesize that the fundamental difference between the bare noun and other NP types is that the maximal projection of the bare noun is a predicate, which is NP, whereas the maximal projection of other phrases is DP (Determiner Phrase).},

  abstract = {Normal children learn tens of thousands of words, and do so quickly and efficiently, often in highly impoverished environments. In How Children Learn the Meanings of Words, I argue that word learning is the product of certain cognitive and linguistic abilities that include the ability to acquire concepts, an appreciation of syntactic cues to meaning, and a rich understanding of the mental states of other people. These capacities are powerful, early emerging, and to some extent uniquely human, but they are not special to word learning. This proposal is an alternative to the view that word learning is the result of simple associative learning mechanisms, and it rejects as well the notion that children possess constraints, either innate or learned, that are specifically earmarked for word learning. This theory is extended to account for how children learn names for objects, substances, and abstract entities, pronouns and proper names, verbs, determiners, prepositions, and number words. Several related topics are also discussed, including na{\"i}ve essentialism, children's understanding of representational art, the nature of numerical and spatial reasoning, and the role of words in the shaping of mental life.},

While such clauses are not factive (Shim and Ihsane 2015), we present elicitation data that shows that nominalized (ta-kes) clauses are felicitously embedded by mit only if their conveyed content was previously asserted in the context; no such restriction arises for non-nominalized clauses. Our analysis of such nominalized embedded clauses argues that they do not denote a proposition ---a set of possible worlds --- but rather a definite description of a discourse event --- an assertion event --- that carries propositional content. The use of ta-kes embedded clauses allows Korean verbs like mit to acquire felicity conditions similar to those proposed for response-stance verbs (e.g. agree, deny) (Cattell 1978, Anand and Hacquard 2014).},

  abstract = {The paper examines two patterns found in one type of copular constructions in Polish, i.e., those containing the verbal copula by{\textasciiacute}c 'be' and the pronominal copula to. In the first pattern the verb by{\textasciiacute}c 'be' agrees with the second, postverbal element, not with the first one, while in the other 1st and 2nd person pronouns are banned from appearing as the first elements in to by{\textasciiacute}c copular clauses. It is argued that these apparently unrelated patterns are amenable to a uniform analysis couched within the minimalist approach to the Person Case Constraint (henceforth, the PCC). This approach crucially relies on the application of multiple Agree and the assumption that in Polish, just like in other languages, T probes separately for person and number. It is argued that in both patterns under consideration T probes the first DP for person and the second one for number and gender, which accounts for agreement with the second element in the first pattern. If the first DP is 1st or 2nd person, it values the person feature of T as 1st or 2nd and this is responsible for a person clash if the second DP is marked for 3rd person, which accounts for the second pattern. The analysis offered predicts that the two DPs in to by{\textasciiacute}c clauses must match in person. It is shown that this prediction may turn out to be problematic in the light of the fact that identity statements and inverted copular sentences allow person mismatch. It is argued that although they seem to be problematic in fact neither in the former nor in the latter the mechanism underlying the PCC effect, i.e., multiple Agree, is operative, but for a different reason. Equatives are analysed along the lines proposed by Perelstvaig (2001; 2008) for Russian and Italian by Moro (1997; 2006), i.e., they are treated as bare small clauses which lack a label unless the second DP is internally merged with the bare small clause and thus provides it with a label (DP). As a result of this movement, the moved DP is closer to the probe T than the other DP, which blocks multiple Agree. In inverted copula sentences, on the other hand, parallel probing by T and C applies, which forces the movement of the inverted element to Spec CP and thus makes it unavailable to Agree with T.},

  abstract = {The present study examined the general hypothesis that, as for nouns, stable representations of semantic knowledge relative to situations expressed by verbs are available and accessible in long term memory in normal people. Regular associations between verbs and past tenses in French adults allowed to abstract two superordinate semantic features in the representation of verb meaning: durativity and resultativity. A pilot study was designed to select appropriate items according to these features: durative, non-resultative verbs and non-durative, resultative verbs. An experimental study was then conducted to assess semantic priming in French adults with two visual semantic-decision tasks at a 200- and 100-ms SOA. In the durativity decision task, participants had to decide if the target referred to a durable or non-durable situation. In the resultativity decision task, they had to decide if it referred to a situation with a directly observable outcome or without any clear external outcome. Targets were preceded by similar, opposite, and neutral primes. Results showed that semantic priming can tap verb meaning at a 200- and 100-ms SOA, with the restriction that only the positive value of each feature benefited from priming, that is the durative and resultative values. Moreover, processing of durativity and resultativity is far from comparable since facilitation was shown on the former with similar and opposite priming, whereas it was shown on the latter only with similar priming. Overall, these findings support Le Ny's (in: Saint-Dizier, Viegas (eds) Computational lexical semantics, 1995; Cahier de Recherche Linguistique LanDisCo 12:85--100, 1998; Comment l'esprit produit du sens, 2005) general hypothesis that classificatory properties of verbs could be interpreted as semantic features and the view that semantic priming can tap verb meaning, as noun meaning.},

As in the early approach, there is no feature checking in intermediate positions of successive-cyclic movement. However, as in the current approach and unlike in early minimalism, successive-cyclic movement starts before the final target of movement enters the structure, and Form Chain is eliminated. The locality of Move and the locality of Agree are shown to be radically different, Agree being free from several mechanisms that constrain Move, namely, phases and the Activation Condition. However, there is no need to take phases to define locality domains of syntax or to posit the Activation Condition as an independent principle. They still hold empirically for Move as theorems. The Generalized EPP (the ``I need a Spec'' property of attracting heads) and the Inverse Case Filter are also dispensable. The traditional Case Filter, stated as a checking requirement, is the sole driving force of A-movement. More generally, Move is always driven by a formal inadequacy (an uninterpretable feature) of the moving element, while Agree is target driven. The system resolves a lookahead problem that arises under the EPP-driven movement approach, where the EPP diacritic indicating that X moves is placed on Y, not X, although X often needs to start moving before Y enters the structure.},

The relevant arguments concern extraction and ellipsis. I argue that ellipsis is phaseconstrained: only phases and complements of phase heads can in principle undergo ellipsis. I show that A{\textasciimacron} -extraction out of an ellipsis site is possible only if the ellipsis site corresponds to a phasal complement. I also provide evidence for the existence of several AspectPs, all of which have morphological manifestations, in the VP domain of English and show that they crucially affect the phasehood of this domain.

The article also demonstrates that moving the element that counts as the phasal edge in multiple specifier/adjunct cases can affect the PIC status of the remaining edges. These conclusions provide a new argument for the contextuality of phasehood. A number of recent works have argued that the phasal status of a phrase can be affected by the syntactic context in which it occurs. This article goes one step further: it shows that the concept of phasal edge, more precisely the status of a specifier/adjunct regarding the PIC, can also be affected by the syntactic context in which the specifier/adjunct occurs. The article also discusses several issues regarding the syntax and semantics of adjectives, possessors, and demonstratives, including what Partee (2006) calls familiar demonstratives, as well as anaphor binding.},

  abstract = {Scalar implicatures are inferences that arise when a weak expression is used instead of a stronger alternative. For example, when a speaker says, ``Some of the children are in the classroom,'' she often implies that not all of them are. Recent processing studies of scalar implicatures have argued that generating an implicature carries a cost. In this study we investigated this cost using a sentence verification task similar to that of Bott and Noveck (2004) combined with a response deadline procedure to estimate speed and accuracy independently. Experiment 1 compared implicit upper-bound interpretations (some [but not all]) with lower-bound interpretations (some [and possibly all]). Experiment 2 compared an implicit upper-bound meaning of some with the explicit upper-bound meaning of only some. Experiment 3 compared an implicit lower-bound meaning of some with the explicit lower-bound meaning of at least some. Sentences with implicatures required additional processing time that could not be attributed to retrieval probabilities or factors relating to semantic complexity. Our results provide evidence against several different types of processing models, including verification and nonverification default implicature models and cost-free contextual models. More generally, our data are the first to provide evidence of the costs associated with deriving implicatures per se.},

  abstract = {Bowers (2010a) proposes that all argument DPs are introduced in the specifiers of `light verb' categories of different types. It is argued in this paper that such a theory is given direct support by the existence of three types of non-event nominals in English whose morphosyntactic and semantic properties correspond precisely to those of the basic argument categories Ag(ent), Th(eme), and Aff(ectee). Assuming that these argument categories are spelled out in derived nominal structures as the morphemes --er/-or, -ment/ion/-ure, -ee, respectively, each type of non-event nominal can be derived by standard syntactic processes such as head movement. The proposed analysis, if correct, extends to derivational morphology the claim of Distributed Morphology (Halle and Marantz, 1993) that word formation is syntactic, not lexical (Marantz, 1997; Embick, 2004; Harley, 2009), thereby making syntax the only generative component of the grammar. It is further shown that if noun incorporation is syntactic, then productive compounds such as deer hunter, painting consignor, etc. can be derived syntactically as well and that the order of incorporated nouns in such structures mirrors precisely the order in which argument categories are merged.},

Many modern authors oppose the value free ideal, claiming that we should not even try to get scientists to eliminate all such non-epistemic value judgements from their reasoning. W. E. B. Du Bois, on the other hand, has a defence of the value free ideal in science that is rooted in a conception of the proper place of science in a democracy. In particular, Du Bois argues that the value free ideal must be upheld in order to, first, retain public trust in science and, second, ensure that those best placed to make use of scientifically acquired information are able to do so. This latter argument turns out to relate Du Bois' position on the value free ideal in science to his defence of epistemic democracy. In this essay I elaborate, motivate, and relate to the modern debate, Du Bois' under-appreciated defence of the value free ideal.},

The rigidity of two object quantifiers follows the pattern of multiple instances of movement crosslinguistically (multiple wh-movement, multiple A-scrambling, multiple object shift): movement paths cross, recreating the hierarchical order of the moving elements (Richards 1997). Hypothesizing that quantifier scope is derived by quantifier-specific syntactic movement, movement that is constrained in the same way as other types of movement, permits these phenomena to be unified under accounts of Relativized Minimality effects generally.},

They are banned from certain nominals for the same reason they are banned from certain VP types like unaccusatives and sporadic advancements: by phrases require the syntactic and semantic presence of an external argument. By phrases can receive a uniform analysis, whether they occur with verbs or in nominals. The analysis proposed here involves syntactic word formation, with syntactic heads effecting passivization and nominalization. It also relies on syntactic selection for selectional features and proposes a theory of such features. The conception of grammar that emerges is one without lexical rules, where passivization and nominalization take place in the syntax.},

We show that these morphemes are not passive at all: like English auxiliaries, they may occur with either an active complement or a passive one. We clarify this point and what it means to be a passive. Second, sentences with these morphemes and the corresponding sentences without them are truth-conditionally equivalent. We show that the extra meaning they convey is a type of projective, or not-at-issue, meaning that is separate from the at-issue content of the sentence. We provide a detailed syntactic and semantic analysis of Vietnamese, and give arguments for this analysis. We propose that there is no movement in Vietnamese, but there is in Chinese, and this difference accounts for differences between the two languages. We also clarify what agent-oriented adverbs of the `deliberately' type show, and draw conclusions about English get passives and tough constructions.},

  abstract = {Pesetsky (1995) argued that both objects in the double object construction must be selected arguments of the lexical verb, based on patterns of optionality. A closer examination shows that this is not correct. The second object of the double object construction and both the NP and PP of the PP frame behave like selected arguments of the lexical verb: the lexical verb determines both whether they can be implicit or not, and how they are interpreted when they are (indefinite versus definite). In contrast, particular lexical verbs determine whether the first object of the double object construction can be dropped, but not how it is interpreted. All implicit first objects are interpreted as pragmatically recoverable definites. Implicit first objects also do not license sluicing, unlike all other implicit objects. I propose a purely syntactic account of these patterns, using the ApplP analysis of double object constructions (Marantz 1993; Bruening 2001). In the analysis, arguments of functional heads like Voice and Appl can only be implicit in the presence of a Pass(ive) head, but arguments of lexical verbs are left implicit through adjunction of an operator to the lexical V. I show that implicit arguments are not projected as NPs in the syntax, contra works like Landau (2010). The failure of sluicing with implicit first objects is then analogous to the failure of sluicing with active-passive pairs. I also suggest that the identity condition on ellipsis makes reference to maximal projections, not to heads as in Rudin (2019).},

  author = {Bruening, Benjamin},
  year = {2023},
  abstract = {The proper analysis of English middles (Politicians bribe easily) has always been a matter of debate. I argue that they involve three crucial components: (1) A base- generated subject that is interpreted as the logical internal argument; (2) a logical external argument that is not syntactically projected at all; (3) the semantics of an ability modal. Regarding (1), I provide new data indicating that the surface subject of the English middle is not derived by A-movement and has no representation in the VP. I propose that the subject is interpreted as the logical internal argument by means of two mechanisms independently proposed to account for other facts: (a) a head that binds a verb's internal argument, proposed for implicit arguments by Bruening (2021); and (b) an abstraction rule triggered by certain varieties of Voice in English, proposed to account for properties of the verbal anaphor do so by Bruening (2019). The abstraction rule causes the unexpressed internal argument of the verb to be bound by the base-generated surface subject of the middle. As for the logical external argument, I show that it is present only semantically and not syntactically. Putative binding in both passives and middles is logophoric, not syntactic. The final component of the analysis is the semantics of an ability modal. English middles are not necessarily generic, they are not necessarily dispositional, they are not necessarily stativ, and they do not require adverbs. The middle, like the passive, is a morphosyntactic category, and it is not useful to try to define a ``middle semantics'' cross-linguistically.},

  author = {Burukina, Irina and Polinsky, Maria},
  year = {2024},
  abstract = {This paper presents and analyzes antipassive constructions with a special focus on antipassives in the Mayan language Kaqchikel. Through the application of several syntactic diagnostics, we contend that, unlike active transitive and Agent Focus constructions, which both have DP-size implicit objects, the implicit object in the antipassive is not projected syntactically. Consequently, antipassive constructions should be construed as a subset of intransitive predications with an external argument, that is, unergatives. This suggests that, contrary to many analyses of the antipassive, the ``suppression'' or ``demotion'' of thematic object is not an inherent characteristic of the construction but rather, a byproduct of its intransitive nature. To accommodate differences between transitive and intransitive constructions more broadly, we propose a typology of v and Voice heads, emphasizing the distinct functions of these functional categories. The external argument in the transitive and in the intransitive are merged in different structural positions, a distinction supported by causativization patterns and, extending beyond Kaqchikel, by scope facts. Transitive, passive, and reflexive constructions all have a Voice projection, whereas Agent Focus and antipassive lack this projection. We provide an evaluation metric of our analysis and existing analyses of antipassives and discuss the implications of our analysis for antipassives beyond Kaqchikel.},

The core idea is a marriage of Kratzer's [Linguistics and Philosophy, 1 (1977), 337] classical analysis of modals as propositional operators with current minimalist ideas about the propositional nature of phases [Chomsky (1999) MITOPL, 18]. This gives rise to two scope positions for modals: one associated with the vP phase, and one with the CP phase. It is shown that the former scope position leads to root readings of modals and the latter to epistemic readings.},

However, during the last several decades, numerals proved to be a rich source of debate in linguistics, especially in semantics and pragmatics. The reason is that the study of numerals requires taking into account core issues such as plurality, quantification, implicature/exhaustivity, degree, modality, imprecision and cross-linguistic variation. In this article, we provide a thorough introduction to the issues connected to numeral semantics and pragmatics. We gradually develop analyses of meanings of numerals in natural language using a multitude of analytical tools. We evaluate the competing proposals in terms of empirical coverage and predictions.},

This allows one to maintain the idea that morphosyntactic features are drawn from a set provided by the UG, i.e., language invariant. The analysis also does not use contextual rules. In order to correctly pair the right ending with a particular root, the analysis only relies on specifying each marker for the features it spells out. The correct pairing of roots and affixes falls out from such a specification and the Nanosyntax model of spellout.},

This paper investigates the behavior of the outcomes of the thematic vowels in three ancient Indo-European languages: Sanskrit, Ancient Greek, and Latin. We show that, on the one hand, Latin thematic vowels are typically ``ornamental'', in that they lack any morpho-syntactico-semantic information, and are used exclusively for classification purposes; on the other hand, Sanskrit and Ancient Greek thematic vowels are fully functional, in that they expone (at least) aspectual information. We argue for a diachronic account of such differential treatment of thematicity across the three languages, whereby the original functionality of such pieces, albeit fully preserved in Sanskrit, was gradually lost over time, and finally gave rise to the Latin verbal ornamental system.},

Seeing nestmates through a glass, ants behaved as usual, i.e. without taking close notice of them. In front of a mirror, they rapidly moved their head and antennae, to the right and the left, touched the mirror, went away from it and stopped, cleaning then sometimes their legs and antennae. As long as they could not see themselves in a mirror, ants with a blue dot painted on their clypeus did not try to remove it. Set in front of a mirror, ants with such a blue dot on their clypeus tried to clean themselves, while ants with a brown painted dot - of the same color as that of their cuticle - on their clypeus and ants with a blue dot on their occiput did not clean themselves. Very young ants did not present such behavior. Contrary to the other kinds of marking, a blue dot on the clypeus induced aggressiveness in nestmates. The front part of the head is thus an essential species specific character for leading to acceptance. Although further experiments are required, preferentially on ants and social hymenoptera with an excellent visual perception, our observations suggest that some ants can recognize themselves when confronted with their reflection view, this potential ability not necessary implicating some self awareness.},

However, some definite noun phrases (e.g. the hospital in Mary had to go the hospital and John did too) seem to violate uniqueness. We discuss a series of experiments that seek to understand some of the properties of this class of definites. We consider most carefully the hypothesis that these ``weak definite'' interpretations arise in implicitly ``incorporated'' constructions, attempting to provide a sketch of this hypothesis' motivation and potential consequences. In our experiments we found that compared to regular definites, the weak definites need not refer uniquely, and readily trigger semantically enriched readings that compete effectively with normal inferences one might draw from a sentence. Perhaps the most surprising finding in the experiments is that nouns that could occur as weak definites, also seemed to retain some of these ``weak'' properties even when expressed as indefinites. We try and make sense of this within the ``incorporation'' framework.},

We critically review the progress in CI research, and its success in improving patient outcomes, from the turn of the century to the present day. The review focuses on the processing, stimulation, and audiological methods that have been used to try to improve speech perception by human CI listeners, and on fundamental new insights in the response of the auditory system to electrical stimulation. The introduction of directional microphones and of new noise reduction and pre-processing algorithms has produced robust and sometimes substantial improvements. Novel speech-processing algorithms, the use of current-focusing methods, and individualised (patient-by-patient) deactivation of subsets of electrodes have produced more modest improvements. We argue that incremental advances have and will continue to be made, that collectively these may substantially improve patient outcomes, but that the modest size of each individual advance will require greater attention to experimental design and power. We also briefly discuss the potential and limitations of promising technologies that are currently being developed in animal models, and suggest strategies for researchers to collectively maximise the potential of CIs to improve hearing in a wide range of listening situations.},

In the other group, there is no nominal functional structure and the ``nominality'' of verbal nouns is epiphenomenal. Instead, I claim that the relevant ``nominal'' properties of this second group are simply the effect of an inherent-case-as-repair strategy used when a structural case position is unavailable due to a variety of causes, including idiosyncratic selectional effects.},

This question was taken up in a linguistic survey and two non-linguistic psychophysical experiments conducted in native speakers of English, Indonesian, Greek, and Spanish. All four of these languages use spatial metaphors to talk about time, but the particular metaphoric mappings between time and space vary across languages. A linguistic corpus study revealed that English and Indonesian tend to map duration onto linear distance (e.g., a long time), whereas Greek and Spanish preferentially map duration onto quantity (e.g., much time). Two psychophysical time estimation experiments were conducted to determine whether this cross-linguistic difference has implications for speakers' temporal thinking. Performance on the psychophysical tasks reflected the relative frequencies of the `time as distance' and `time as quantity' metaphors in English, Indonesian, Greek, and Spanish. This was true despite the fact that the tasks used entirely nonlinguistic stimuli and responses. Results suggest that: (1.) The spatial metaphors in our native language may profoundly influence the way we mentally represent time. (2.) Language can shape even primitive, low-level mental processes such as estimating brief durations -- an ability we share with babies and non-human animals.},

  abstract = {This paper presents an Optimality Theoretic analysis of aspiration in the Scandinavian language Faroese using gestural score representations from Articulatory Phonology. In Faroese, a strong parallel exists between pre- and post-aspiration such that neither realization appears to be inherently preferred. This symmetry is straightforwardly captured by alignment within gestural scores, but runs counter to the treatments of pre-aspiration in traditional linear and autosegmental theories, where such segments are inherently more complex than their post-aspirated counterparts. An OT analysis that makes use of the alignment-based distinction in gestural scores is therefore proposed for the Faroese data. The account incorporates cross-linguistic preferences for post-aspiration and the correlation observed between stress and aspiration, yet pre-aspiration surfaces in many of the Faroese environments. Laryngeal alignment preferences are also analyzed as the basis of apparent contrast neutralization and sonorant devoicing in consonant sequences, and provide the framework for a grounded analysis of the interaction seen among consonant length, vowel quality and aspiration. Based on the analytic benefits of incorporating rich representational structure into the OT framework seen here and elsewhere, the potential for such theories to contribute to the advancement of phonological theory appears to be considerable.},

In dialogue with James McGilvray, Professor of Philosophy at McGill University, Chomsky takes up a wide variety of topics - the nature of language, the philosophies of language and mind, morality and universality, science and common sense, and the evolution of language. McGilvray's extensive commentary helps make this incisive set of interviews accessible to a variety of readers. The volume is essential reading for those involved in the study of language and mind, as well as anyone with an interest in Chomsky's ideas"--},

Since then inquiry has gained far greater scope and depth. It has also led to sharpening of fundamental principles of language. At first, descriptive adequacy appeared to require rich and complex assumptions about UG. A primary goal has always been to overcome this deficiency. Core properties of concern have included compositionality, order, projection (labeling), and displacement. Early work assigned the first three to phrase structure rules and the last to the transformational component. Simplification of computational procedures suggests that compositionality and displacement (along with the ``copy theory'') fall together while order may be a reflex of sensorimotor externalization, conclusions that have far-reaching consequences. As for labeling, minimal computation restricts options to the few that have considerable empirical support.},

  abstract = {There is substantial evidence that the human language capacity (LC) is a species-specific biological property, essentially unique to humans, invariant among human groups, and dissociated from other cognitive systems. Each language, an instantiation of LC, consists of a generative procedure that yields a discrete infinity of hierarchically structured expressions with semantic interpretations, hence a kind of ``language of thought'' (LOT), along with an operation of externalization (EXT) to some sensory-motor system, typically sound. There is mounting evidence that generation of LOT observes language-independent principles of computational efficiency and is based on the simplest computational operations, and that EXT is an ancillary process not entering into the core semantic properties of LOT and is the primary locus of the apparent complexity, diversity, and mutability of language. These conclusions are not surprising, since the internal system is acquired virtually without evidence in fundamental respects, and EXT relates it to sensory-motor systems that are unrelated to it. Even such properties as the linear order of words appear to be reflexes of the sensory motor system, not available to generation of LOT. The limited evidence from the evolutionary record lends support to these conclusions, suggesting that LC emerged with Homo sapiens or not long after, and has not evolved since human groups dispersed.},

  abstract = {The present article examines production and on-line processing of definite articles in Turkish-speaking sequential bilingual children acquiring English and Dutch as second languages (L2) in the UK and in the Netherlands, respectively. Thirty-nine 6?8-year-old L2 children and 48 monolingual (L1) age-matched children participated in two separate studies examining the production of definite articles in English and Dutch in conditions manipulating semantic context, that is, the anaphoric and the bridging contexts. Sensitivity to article omission was examined in the same groups of children using an on-line processing task involving article use in the same semantic contexts as in the production task. The results indicate that both L2 children and L1 controls are less accurate when definiteness is established by keeping track of the discourse referents (anaphoric) than when it is established via world knowledge (bridging). Moreover, despite variable production, all groups of children were sensitive to the omission of definite articles in the on-line comprehension task. This suggests that the errors of omission are not due to the lack of abstract syntactic representations, but could result from processes implicated in the spell-out of definite articles. The findings are in line with the idea that variable production in child L2 learners does not necessarily indicate lack of abstract representations (Haznedar and Schwartz, 1997).},

Furthermore, biomedical research has been fundamental for ensuring that the multielectrode implant is safe as well as effective.

This paper presents novel data from the Panoan language Amahuaca, in which ergative case is sensitive to the position of the transitive subject. The interaction of movement and morphological case assignment in Amahuaca cannot easily be captured by current inherent or dependent case theories. Instead, I argue that a view of ergative case as exponing agreement with multiple functional heads (specifically v and T) is able to account for the Amahuaca data, while incorporating key insights from both inherent and dependent case theories of ergativity. I further demonstrate that this approach that takes case to be the exponence of multiple features is able to be extended to account for elements of the language's casesensitive switch-reference system as well as its focus-sensitive nominative marking. The Amahuaca data thus suggest that ergative case can be viewed as a feature bundle, rather than a single case feature, and that morphological ergative marking arises as the exponence of structural relationships between multiple heads and a nominal.},

On the XP(-remnant)-movement account, either i) a maximal projection containing the predicate raises to the left of the subject (VOS), or ii) the object leaves the predicate before predicate fronting ensues (VSO). Both of these accounts correctly predict that the verb and the object form a prosodic constituent in VOS clauses. In addition, the right-side specifier account predicts the existence of a strong prosodic boundary between the subject and the object in VSO, which is not borne out in the data.},

Significantly, objects in these clauses cannot be marked with accusative case. Based on the approach to nominalizations suggested in Borsley and Kornfilt (2000), we derive the case marking pattern in nominalized clauses from the level at which nominalization applies in the derivation. We also analyze the genitive subjects in Quechua as licensed by C (as in Turkish) rather than by D (as suggested in recent work by Miyagawa for Japanese). {\ss} 2011 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {A number of claims and counter-claims which have been made concerning get-passives in English are tested via interrogation of a set of written and spoken corpora. Get-passives are shown to form a fuzzy set, with about one-third of corpus tokens belonging to a `core'whosemembers have an explicit or at least accessible agent-phrase, a lexical verb with typically dynamic meaning, and which alternate with an active clause. Beyond the core there are a number of subclasses displaying progressively fewer features in common with core members. On the borderline of the set are copular constructions, with get a `resulting copula' and the participle fully adjectivalized. The data suggest that get-passives are very often associated with two types of pragmatic implicature: one, that the subject-referent is responsible for initiating the process (very evident in the semantically-related complex reflexive construction); the other, that the process is (usually) unfavourable or (less often) favourable for the subject-referent. Finally, the corpus provides evidence of at least three types of variation with get-passives: regional (their frequency is comparable in American English and British English, higher in Australian English than in both of these, and higher in Indian English than in Australian English); stylistic (they tend to be avoided in more formal styles); and diachronic (they are increasing in popularity over time in Australian English, and probably in the other varieties).},

The main line of approach in the recent literature is to attribute these effects to failures of ␾-Agree or, more specifically, failures of nominal licensing or case checking. We propose that the problem in these configurations is unrelated to nominal licensing, but is instead the result of a probe participating in more than one Agree dependency, a configuration we refer to as feature gluttony. Feature gluttony does not in and of itself lead to ungrammaticality; rather, it can create irresolvably conflicting requirements for subsequent operations. We argue that in the case of clitic configurations, a probe that agrees with more than one DP creates an intervention problem for clitic doubling. In violations involving morphological agreement, gluttony in features may result in a configuration with no available morphological output.},

  abstract = {Many languages of the Mayan family restrict the extraction of transitive (ergative) subjects for focus, wh-questions, and relativization (A{\textasciimacron} -extraction). We follow Aissen ( b) in labelling this restriction the ergative extraction constraint (EEC). In this paper, we offer a unified account of the EEC within Mayan languages, as well as an analysis of the special construction known as Agent Focus (AF) used to circumvent it. Specifically, we propose that the EEC has a similar source across the subset of Mayan languages which exhibit it: intervention. The intervention problem is created when an object DP structurally intervenes between the A{\textasciimacron} -probe on C and the ergative subject. Evidence that intervention by the object is the source of the problem comes from a handful of exceptional contexts which permit transitive subjects to extract in languages which normally ban this extraction, and conversely, a context which exceptionally bans ergative extraction in a language which otherwise allows it. We argue that the problem with A{\textasciimacron} -extracting the ergative subject across the intervening object connects to the requirements of the A{\textasciimacron} -probe on C : the probe on C is bundled to search simultaneously for [A{\textasciimacron} ] and [D] features. This relates the Mayan patterns to recent proposals for extraction patterns in Austronesian languages (e.g. Legate ; Aldridge b) and elsewhere (van Urk ). Specifically, adapting the proposal of Coon and Keine (to appear), we argue that in configurations in which a DP object intervenes between the probe on C and an A{\textasciimacron} -subject, conflicting requirements on movement lead to a derivational crash. While we propose that the EEC has a uniform source across the family, we argue that AF constructions vary Mayan-internally in how they circumvent the EEC, accounting for the variation in behavior of AF across the family. This paper both contributes to our understanding of parametric variation internal to the Mayan family, as well as to the discussion of variation in A{\textasciimacron} -extraction asymmetries and syntactic ergativity cross-linguistically.},

  abstract = {The paper presents a unitary syntactic and interpretative account of nominal ellipsis in Romanian DPs. As a Discourse Grammar phenomenon, nominal ellipsis is a double trope, involving both anaphoricity and contrastivity. On the one hand, it presupposes the retrieval of a suitable discourse antecedent. Since the ellipsis site is anaphorically related to the antecedent, it will be syntactically definite. Definiteness valuation is thus obligatory in any DP which contains an ellipsis site, and it is this step which provides the unity of nominal ellipsis. On the other hand, ellipsis also involves contrastivity of the remnant with respect to the same antecedent, a feature which entails the existence of a Focus projection, filled by merger or movement to the left periphery.},

  abstract = {In this study, we address the mapping problem for modal words: how do children learn the form-tomeaning mappings for words like could or have to in their input languages? Learning modal words poses considerable challenges as their meanings are conceptually complex and the way these meanings are mapped to grammatical forms and structures is likewise complex and cross-linguistically variable. Against a backdrop of how cross-linguistic modal systems can vary, we focus on new work highlighting the developmental roles of the following: (a) syntactic categories of modal words, (b) interrelationships between modal `force' (possibility and necessity) and `flavour' (root and epistemic), (c) semantic representations for modal forms and (d) children's own emerging modal systems, as a whole, which show that the way they map forms to the `modal meaning space' (considering both force and flavour dimensions) diverges from how adults do, even if the same forms are present. Modality provides a rich natural laboratory for exploring the interrelationships between our conceptual world of possibilities, how concepts get packaged by the syntax--semantics of grammatical systems, and how child learners surmount these form-meaning mapping challenges.},

The existence of passive construction in Persian has been a controversial issue in the transformational treatments of Persian. A group of scholars have postulated the existence of 'passive' in Persian, while at least one linguist has called this construction 'inchoative.' In this paper I discuss the 'passive' and the 'inchoative' approaches to the notion 'passive voice' in Persian and finally suggest that in addition to the category of inchoative constructions there is a syntactic category of passive in Persian. I will show that a definable subset of passive constructions in Persian may optionally undergo another syntactic process that produces a surface structure which is potentially ambiguous between an inchoative and a passive interpretation. I will claim that the transformational rule of passive in Persian is a governed rule in the sense that it applies to a semantically definable class of verbs.},

The target language of this study is Vedic Sanskrit, the language of the sacred texts of Hinduism. The main focus of the paper concerns the evolution of the Vedic past tense system, which at the beginning of the Vedic tradition is aspect-based and later develops into a system where temporal remoteness and evidentiality distinctions determine the distribution of the past tense categories. This language therefore offers a particularly intriguing data set for exploring the diachronic relationship between aspect, proximal tense and evidentiality, a field of diachronic semantics which has only received limited attention in the research literature.},

  abstract = {Modern Hebrew differentiates between definite and indefinite objects, using a prepositional object marker only in front of definites. This article explores the hypothesis that lack of an object marker when the object is indefinite follows from lack of abstract Case on indefinite objects. It is shown that indefinites in Hebrew are allowed in various other positions in which Case seems to be unavailable and in which definites are not allowed, a fact that receives a straightforward account under the proposed hypothesis that indefinites do not require Case. The possibility of having Caseless indefinites is then argued to follow from lack of a DP projection in Hebrew indefinites. The second part of this article aims to show that an analysis of indefinites in Hebrew as lacking a DP projection is indeed possible and can be motivated on independent grounds. This involves a reexamination of the arguments that have motivated the influential N-to-D analysis of Semitic noun phrases. I claim that most previous work on Semitic nominals is in fact compatible with an analysis in which nouns do not raise as high as the D position, and that the hypothesis that indefinites in Hebrew are not full DPs has some explanatory advantages over the view that all construct state nominals in Hebrew are DPs.},

  abstract = {Some languages showing morphological ergativity in case and/or agreement also show ergative patterns in core syntactic domains---syntactic ergativity. The most-studied type of syntactic ergativity is a ban on the A{\textasciimacron} movement of ergative subjects; an additional type concerns the distribution of absolutives in nonfinite clauses. This article first presents the standard view of syntactic ergativity, which is closely connected to the treatment of ergative as an inherent case. Evidence from Shipibo suggests that a ban on ergative A{\textasciimacron} extraction does not require inherent ergative. This points to a view of syntactic ergativity centered around morphological case discrimination. One consequence is that pure head-marking languages cannot feature a true ban on ergative extraction, because ergative morphological case is not in use. This conclusion highlights the challenging tasks of diagnosing extraction restrictions in pure head-marking languages, as in the Mayan and Salish families, and of distinguishing extraction restrictions from instances where extraction merely interacts with agreement. A variety of crosslinguistic evidence suggests that agreement/extraction interactions are fully possible in morphologically ergative languages, and not only for ergative arguments. Special morphology in the context of transitive subject extraction is therefore not necessarily evidence of syntactic ergativity.},

  abstract = {The person-case constraint (PCC) is a family of restrictions on the relative person of the two objects of a ditransitive. PCC effects offer a testing ground for theories of the Agree operation and of syntactic features, both those on nominals and (of special interest here) those found on agreement probes. In this paper, I offer a new theory of PCC effects in an interaction/satisfaction theory of Agree (Deal 2015a) and show the advantages of this framework in capturing PCC typology. On this model, probes are specified for interaction features, determining which features will be copied to them, and satisfaction features, determining which features will cause probing to stop. Applied to PCC, this theory (i) captures all four types of PCC effect recognized by Nevins (2007), under a unified notion of Agree; (ii) captures the restriction of PCC effects to contexts of ``Double Weakness'' in many prominent examples, e.g. in Italian, Greek, and Basque, where PCC effects hold only in cases where both the direct and indirect object are expressed with clitics; (iii) naturally extends to PCC effects in syntactic environments without visible clitics or agreement for one or both objects, as well as the absence of PCC effects in some languages with clitics or agreement for both the direct and indirect object. Two refinements of the interaction/satisfaction theory are offered. The first is a new notation for probes' interaction and satisfaction specifications, clarifying the absence from this theory of uninterpretable/unvalued features as drivers of Agree. The second is a proposal for the way that probes' behavior may change over the course of a derivation, dubbed dynamic interaction.},

This agenda also aims at a model for other communities in the Global South where linguistic discrimination has disenfranchised large segments of the population most in need of socio-economic progress.},

  abstract = {In their target article, Anne Charity Hudley, Christine Mallinson, and Mary Bucholtz (2020) have challenged linguists to constructively engage with race and racism. They suggest three core principles for inclusion and equity in linguistics: (i) `social impact' as a core criterion for excellence; (ii) the acknowledgment of our field's `origins as a tool of colonialism and conquest'; and (iii) the elimination of the `race gap' that `diminishes the entire field {\dots} by excluding scholars and students of color'. Here I amplify Charity Hudley et al.'s challenges through some of my own critiques of Creole studies. These critiques serve to further analyze institutional whiteness as, in their terms, `a structuring force in academia, informing the development of theories, methods, and models in ways that reproduce racism and white supremacy'. The latter is exceptionally overt in the prejudicial misrepresentations (a.k.a. `Creole exceptionalism') that we linguists have created and transmitted, since the colonial era, about Creole languages and their speakers. One such misrepresentation, whose popularity trumps its dubious historical and empirical foundations, starts with the postulation that Creole languages as a class contrast with so-called `regular' languages due to allegedly `abnormal' processes of emergence and transmission. In effect, then, Creole studies may well be the most spectacular case of exclusion and marginalization in linguistics. With this in mind, I ask of Charity Hudley et al. a key question that is inspired by legal scholar Derrick Bell's `racial interest-convergence theory', whereby those in power will actively work in favor of racial justice only when such work also contributes to their self-interest. Given this theory, how can we sustainably implement any agenda, including Charity Hudley et al.'s, that stands to undermine the `structuring power of white supremacy', including the power to choose whose research gets funded or whose subfield is included in `core' linguistics? Bell's theory might also bear on my proposed funder principle for the intellectual history of Creole studies. I suggest that it is out of self-interest that the European funders of the colonial enterprise in Africa and the Americas helped create the power-knowledge structuring force that accounts for the genesis and transmission of Creole exceptionalism through centuries---in spite of mounting evidence against it. I end with an optimistic note about what might constitute `success' in linguistics.},

The development of brain imaging techniques has opened the possibilities of studying human infants without discomfort, and although these studies are still sparse, several characteristics are noticeable in the human infant's brain: first, parallel and hierarchical processing pathways are observed before intense exposure to speech with an efficient temporal coding in the left hemisphere and, second, frontal regions are involved from the start in infants' cognition. These observations are certainly not sufficient to explain language acquisition but illustrate a new approach that relies on a better description of infants' brain activity during linguistic tasks, which is compared to results in animals and human adults to clarify the neural bases of language in humans.},

We focus on the distinction between pragmatic and lexical constraints accounts. High-functioning children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) offer a unique perspective on this debate, as they acquire substantial vocabularies despite impoverished social-pragmatic skills. We tested children and adolescents with ASD in a paradigm examining mutual exclusivity for words and facts. Words were interpreted contrastively more often than facts. Word performance was associated with vocabulary size; fact performance was associated with social-communication skills. Thus mutual exclusivity does not appear to be driven by pragmatics, suggesting that it is either a lexical constraint or a reflection of domain-general learning processes.},

Moskal and Smith, 2015). This study contributes to this debate by investigating the root allomorphy patterns in Laz, an endangered South Caucasian language spoken primarily in Turkey. In each case of root allomorphy in Laz, the root is required to be linearly adjacent to the morpheme that conditions the allomorphy. Moreover, Laz exhibits (what will be called) non-linear blocking effects on allomorphy: Some prefixes can prevent a suffix from conditioning allomorphy on the root. Importantly, this case constitutes evidence that linear adjacency is not a sufficient condition on suppletive allomorphy and is at odds with the view that the domain of grammar responsible for selecting exponents operates on linearized structures (cf. Embick, 2010).},

The formalist tradition has, in a variety of ways, approached this phenomenon predominantly in terms of an agreement relationship between two terms of a syntactic structure---for instance, the subject and the finite verb (typically showing agreement for person and number), or the object and a past participle (which, e.g. in the Romance languages, may agree for number and gender, but not for person). But not all these agreement relationships affect all phi-features equally, which raises the question of whether there is to be a unified approach to phi-features in general. And two terms that can entertain an agreement relationship for certain phi-features do not seem to engage in such agreement every time they might be expected to so do. On the surface, plural subjects can co-occur with singularly inflected finite verbs, and vice versa; and sometimes a subpart of the subject seems to control the selection of the inflection on the finite verb, in so-called `attraction' cases. These kinds of phenomena give rise to an in-depth exploration of the nature and reality of agreement relationships, including the possibility of an analysis treating phi-featural properties as autonomous vis-{\`a}-vis one another, assigned to each term separately, not under agreement. This special issue brings together a collection of papers and commentaries reflecting on these matters in various ways. In this introduction, I set the stage for the discussion to follow.},

This dual licensing dependency explains the restrictions on the distribution of which as the relative clause operator in contrastive-focus it-clefts. Continuous-topic it-clefts are structurally assimilated to pseudorelative constructions, which accounts for the restrictions on the realisation of the left periphery of their relative clause.},

  urldate = {2024-02-13},
  abstract = {The Extended Projection Principle (EPP) formalizes the requirement for a subject in every clause. In this dissertation, I develop a typology of EPP effects based on a sample of typologically, geographically, and genetically diverse languages. I define the EPP as the obligatory movement of some element into the inflectional domain, and argue that the EPP can vary in three different dimensions: (i) whether an argument or a predicate is the goal of the EPP-probe, (ii) whether the goal is a head or a phrase, and (iii) whether a larger constituent is pied-piped. I demonstrate that these three dimensions interact to create a total of seven different attested EPP types across languages. I demonstrate that intra-linguistic alternations in EPP type are attested, which provide evidence that these types are functionally equivalent on some level. I also present the hypothesis that the EPP type of a language should be predictable based on other properties of the language. As such, I discuss several properties that co-occur with particular EPP types cross-linguistically. For example, predicate-EPP languages pattern together by having a high, defective T head, which results in a set of shared properties, including: (i) a lack of non-finite clauses, (ii) high or preverbal tense marking, (iii) a T merged with C, and (iv) defective definiteness marking. On the other hand, I show that the null subject type of a language does not correlate with EPP type. Finally, I also propose two different functional purposes for the EPP. First, I propose that the EPP has an anchoring function, linking the utterance to the world by raising an element marked with an index to a position of prominence. I present the hypothesis that all operations within the inflectional domain have an anchoring function. Second, I argue that the dichotomy between predicate and argument EPP languages can be explained if we understand the EPP as a high predication operation, which raises either the predicate or the argument to a position which c-commands the other. I then propose that all anchoring operations, including the EPP, have dual functions, thus incorporating the two functions of the EPP.},

  abstract = {While it is widely acknowledged in the formal semantic literature that both the truth-functional focus particle only and it-clefts convey exhaustiveness, the nature and source of exhaustiveness effects with it-clefts remain contested. We describe a questionnaire study (n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 80) and an event-related brain potentials (ERP) study (n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 16) that investigated the violation of exhaustiveness in German only-foci versus it-clefts. The offline study showed that a violation of exhaustivity with only is less acceptable than the violation with it-clefts, suggesting a difference in the nature of exhaustivity interpretation in the two environments. The ERPresults confirm that this difference can be seen in online processing as well: a violation of exhaustiveness in only-foci elicited a centro-posterior positivity (600--800ms), whereas a violation in it-clefts induced a globally distributed N400 pattern (400--600ms). The positivity can be interpreted as a reanalysis process and more generally as a process of context updating. The N400 effect in it-clefts is interpreted as indexing a cancelation process that is functionally distinct from the only case. The ERP study is, to our knowledge, the first evidence from an online experimental paradigm which shows that the violation of exhaustiveness involves different underlying processes in the two structural environments. {\'O} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {Abstract             Pseudo-noun incorporation describes a phenomenon in which an argument forms a ``closer than usual'' relation with the verb. This book provides a detailed cross-linguistic study of pseudo-noun incorporation, based on elicitation with speakers of Tamil, Mongolian, Korean, Turkish, and German. Five diagnostics are applied across eleven noun types in each of the languages under consideration. What emerges is a coherent effect of pseudo-incorporated arguments that maps loss of case marking to obligatory narrow scope, lack of binding and control relations, and a potentially restricted movement pattern. This book provides a unifying theory that is able to capture all properties with a single assumption. Pseudo-incorporation effects result from noun phrases that are made up of a nominal and a verbal category feature. Implemented in a derivational framework, the nominal feature is active early in the derivation being responsible for c-selection and nominal modification, the verbal feature is active late and crucially derives the effects we have come to recognize as pseudo-noun incorporation. One important empirical contribution of this study stems from the observation that pseudo-incorporation does not have to be the only reason for optional case marking. Tamil and Korean provide evidence that only a subset of optionally case-marked noun types also show a correlation with scope, binding, control, and movement constraints. This insight enforces the conclusion that the same language can make use of both pseudo-noun incorporation and differential object marking.},

This paper compares two competing hypotheses for this location: the high aspect account, in which going to/gonna is a modal with be in a high functional head above it, and the little v account, in which future be going to is quite similar to the progressive main verb in structure. I observe that these proposals make contrasting predictions regarding additional material in the inflectional domain: the high aspect account prohibits future be going to from being preceded by a modal or have, while the little v account makes no such restriction. The synchronic accounts likewise represent differing views on the diachronic grammaticalization process. I test these predictions in two online experiments: a task in which participants determine the grammaticality of sentences containing be gonna, and a task in which participants determine whether sentences containing be going to take a future or motion reading. Results show that be gonna is ungrammatical when preceded by modals/perfect, and be going to takes more of a motion reading in the same context. Both tasks strongly favor the high aspect account. This supports syntactic approaches to grammaticalization that take items to move into and up the clausal spine.},

This joint determination of aspectual class is based on a very close relation between a verb and one of its arguments, which is called ``incrementality.'' In this chapter, we will introduce different kinds of incrementality, present their semantics in detail, and discuss recent developments in the theory of incrementality.},

In recent years, a growing body of work suggests it is possible to find concrete phonetic and phonological evidence that recursion in syntactic structure is preserved in the prosodic organization of utterances (Ladd 1986, 1988; Kubozono 1989, 1992; F{\'e}ry and Truckenbrodt 2005; Wagner 2005, 2010; Selkirk 2009, 2011; Ito and Mester 2013; Myrberg 2013). This paper argues that the distribution of phrase-level phrase accents in Connemara Irish provides a new type of evidence in favour of this hypothesis: that, under ideal conditions, syntactic constituents are mapped onto prosodic constituents in a one-to-one fashion, such that information about the nested relationships between syntactic constituents is preserved through the recursion of prosodic domains. Through an empirical investigation of both clausal and nominal constructions, I argue that the distribution of phrasal phrase accents in Connemara Irish can be used as a means of identifying recursive bracketing in prosodic structure.},

  abstract = {This thesis is a study of grammatical voice. Specifically, I focus on how the syntax of voice alternations relates to the morphological and (and to some extent the interpretive) components of the grammar. Based on an analysis of voice syncretisms, cases in which the verb appearing in distinct syntactic alternations is realized with the same morphology, I argue that voice morphology does not bring about syntactic changes, but instead reflects syntactic configurations. Voice morphology is dissociated. I also address the syntax of participles and the English passive. I show that the key to understanding the syntax of the English passive lies in understanding the constituent parts of which it is composed, namely be and participial phrase. All passives are treated as predicative structures like those found with be elsewhere, with the participial phrase being a sort of adjective with possible eventive and agentive semantics. I discuss further implications of this approach for voice morphology in languages with synthetic passives. The third chapter investigates deponent verbs, verbs which only appear with 'passive' morphology. I show verbal classes of this type provide important evidence for a theory in which morphology interprets the output of syntax. I analyze these verbs as possessing a morphological feature inherently; verbs in syntactic alternations also appear with the identical feature, leading to an abstract morphological identity. In addition, I present an analysis which characterizes the possible types of deponent verbal classes, and which shows that the interactions of morphological voice features are tightly constrained. In addition, I that understanding the properties of deponent verbs leads to important results in analyzing the various kinds of features involved in the grammar.},

The Aspect head involved in resultative participles is shown to attach to a vP that is also found in (a) the formation of deadjectival verbs and (b) verb phrases with resultative secondary predicates, like John hammered the metal flat. These distinct constructions are shown to have a shared structural subcomponent.

  abstract = {Within Distributed Morphology, it has been proposed that the lexical vocabulary consists of Roots: category-less primitives. The motivation for Roots is connected with a line of argument reaching back to Chomsky's ``Remarks on Nominalization'' concerning the representation of lexical categories and their role in syntax. At the center of the theory of Roots is the Two Domains Intuition: the idea that there are two different types of domains in which grammatical interactions (form: allomorphy; meaning: allosemy) occur. Roots are posited as part of an argument against lexicalist approaches to the Two Domains Intuition that reduce it to a modular distinction between the lexicon and the syntax. In place of the modular distinction, Root-based approaches hypothesize that domain differences are derivative of syntactic locality effects in a way that connects with the phase theory of Minimalist syntax. This review examines developments leading to current versions of a Roots-and-contexts theory. A particular focus is on the idea that separating lexical Roots from the morphemes that categorize them is essential to defining the distinct locality domains that are posited to explain the effects subsumed under the Two Domains Intuition.},

The primary focus concerns the scope of competition for grammaticality. While discussions of blocking are often directed at particular parts of the grammar (e.g. derivational morphology) the larger set of questions raised by (putative) blocking effects has the potential to distinguish predictions made by major theoretical movements like the Minimalist Program and Optimality Theory, precisely because of the different roles they attribute to competition. This review of theories of blocking is oriented towards larger questions of this type. It also examines the apparent absence of blocking: cases in which it looks as if one form should (all else being equal) block another, yet both exist. Observations to this effect appear in early and influential accounts of blocking, where they have underappreciated theoretical consequences concerning how the `paradigm space' associated with words and phrases is structured. A key theme throughout the entry is whether the phenomena that have been described as blocking effects are derivative of one grammatical (or extragrammatical) mechanism, or several. While the authors conclude that the latter view is correct, part of their argument is that the focus on unity is less important than the question of what evidence for (or against) competition in a given domain would look like in the first place.},

  author = {Embick, David},
  year = {2023},
  month = may,
  journal = {Acta Linguistica Academia},
  abstract = {One of the basic questions in the theory of morphology concerns the nature of word formation: how morphemes are assembled into larger objects, and---- crucially---- whether there are distinct systems in which this occurs (lexicon versus syntax), or just one. Stative (a.k.a. ``adjectival'') passives like opened in the opened door, or flattened in the metal is flattened, have provided an interesting testing ground for questions of this type. Following a period in which such passives were argued to be formed lexically, much subsequent work has developed the idea that they are derived syntactically, in fully phrasal structures. This paper examines a number of properties of English stative passives which raise problems for a fully phrasal treatment. These include (but are not limited to) (i) modification asymmetries relative to eventive passives; and (ii) interactions with un-prefixation. The generalizations that are revealed suggest that stative passives are built syntactically, but without phrasal internal structure: what I call small(er) syntax. Importantly, small structures are not tantamount to a lexical analysis; I provide a direct comparison that argues that the evidence favors the smaller type of approach. The argument for small structures also has implications for the syntax of Roots that are introduced throughout the discussion.},

Moreover, it does so by employing simplest Merge and third-factor minimal search for label identification. Our extension of Chomsky's analysis to A-movement operates without any appeal to Merge-over- Move or to lexical arrays or subarrays. This in turn renders the concept ``phase'' itself no longer necessary in analyzing the core cases of illicit A-movement, shown to reduce to labeling failure. Implications of this result and the nature of the long-standing evidence for strict cyclicity are discussed.},

Syntax has as its only operation Merge, and agreement, now divorced from syntax, transfers purely morphological information from head to head along channels established via syntactic feature checking. Separating agreement from structure building seems to enable more elegant descriptions of even complicated agreement phenomena.},

That is, the semantic values associated with words are flexible, open-ended and highly dependent on the utterance context in which they are embedded. In attempting to provide an account of meaningconstruction that coheres with this observation I develop a cognitivelyrealistic theory of lexical representation and a programmatic theory of lexical concept integration. My fundamental claim is that there is a basic distinction between lexical concepts, and meaning. While lexical concepts constitute the semantic units conventionally associated with linguistic forms, and form an integral part of a language user's individual mental grammar, meaning is a property of situated usage-events, rather than words. That is, meaning is not a function of language per se, but arises from language use. I present an account of lexical concepts and the conceptual knowledge structures, cognitive models, with respect to which they are relativised. I also situate this theory within a usage-based account. I then develop a theory of lexical concept integration which serves to provide an account of how lexical concepts are combined in service of situated meaning-construction. As the constructs lexical concept and cognitive model are central to the theory of lexical representation and meaningconstruction I present, I refer to the approach developed here as the Theory of Lexical Concepts and Cognitive Models, or LCCM Theory.},

Some theoretical accounts argue that listeners have different expectations about the speech of non-native speakers. Other accounts argue that nonnative speech is processed differently to the extent that a foreign accent taxes intelligibility and introduces additional processing load. Here we test the role of expectations for the processing of native vs. non-native speech in written texts where accents cannot be directly perceived (and thus affect processing load). In Experiment 1, native comprehenders gave higher ratings to the meaning of under-informative sentences (``Some people have noses with two nostrils'') when they believed that the sentences were produced by non-native compared to native speakers. This difference was larger the more likely individual participants were to interpret under-informative sentences pragmatically (as opposed to logically). In Experiment 2, the tendency to forgive sins of information omission was shown to depend on the presumed L2 proficiency of non-native speakers. Experiment 3 replicated and extended the major finding. Since intelligibility of the sentences was identical across types of speakers, these findings provide support for the role of expectations for non-native speech comprehension, as well as for broader models of language processing that argue for a role of speaker identity.},

Cinque (1988), Egerland (2003), a.o., argued that there are two types of impersonal pronouns; one type that can occur in multiple syntactic positions but can only have a generic reading and another type that can have generic and existential readings but can only occur as an external argument. I show, based on novel data from ECM constructions, passives and unaccusatives, that it is not the syntactic position which restricts the distribution of men-type pronouns, but that it is case. English-type pronouns can occur with multiple cases, but can only have a generic inclusive reading. All Dutch-type pronouns can only occur with nominative case and can have multiple impersonal readings. Moreover, I show that Dutch and Swedish allow an existential reading when the pronoun is a derived subject (contra Cinque 1988, Egerland 2003). I propose a direction for this correlation between the different readings and case by assuming different feature make-ups for the pronouns, following Egerland (2003), Hoekstra (2010), Ackema and Neeleman (2018): one has {$\varphi$} -features and, therefore, always needs to be obligatorily inclusive; men lacks this functional layer and, therefore, has no restriction on its readings. Furthermore, I propose that since men lacks a phi-layer, it is too deficient to project a KP, and thus can only occur with unmarked nominative case.},

  abstract = {This contribution aims at offering a state of the art about experimental research on mechanisms for referential and relational coherence, pivotal for the construction of discourse in the interlocutors' aim to recover of a relevant assumption in communication. The construction of discourse is a cognitive `activity' that consists in decoding linguistic material of utterances and performing a series of mental operations to recover a relevant interpretation in a communicative exchange. For that purpose, interlocutors put to use linguistic mechanisms directed at establishing `referential coherence' and `relational coherence' to achieve discourse `connectedness'. The cognitive effects of these mechanisms in terms of their consequences for discourse processing and interpretation can be approached by means of experimentation. Doing so allows the researcher to enrich scientific findings as provided by linguistic description and observational studies, helps refining theories of human verbal communication and comes along with a strong transfer potential for applied endeavors. Alternate abstract: Esta contribuci{\'o}n ofrece un estado de la cuesti{\'o}n acerca de la investigaci{\'o}n experimental sobre los mecanismos de coherencia referencial y relacional, fundamentales para la construcci{\'o}n del discurso y para la recuperaci{\'o}n de un supuesto relevante durante la comunicaci{\'o}n. La construcci{\'o}n del discurso es una actividad cognitiva que consiste en descodificar el material ling{\"u}{\'i}stico de los enunciados y en llevar a cabo una serie de operaciones mentales para recuperar una interpretaci{\'o}n relevante en un intercambio comunicativo. Para ello los interlocutores ponen en marcha mecanismos ling{\"u}{\'i}sticos dirigidos a establecer la coherencia referencial y la coherencia relacional y, para conectar el discurso. Los efectos cognitivos de estos mecanismos -sus consecuencias para el procesamiento y la interpretaci{\'o}n del discurso- se pueden abordar a trav{\'e}s de la experimentaci{\'o}n. La aproximaci{\'o}n experimental permite al investigador enriquecer hallazgos cient{\'i}ficos derivados de estudios descriptivos y de la observaci{\'o}n, contribuye a matizar teor{\'i}as sobre el funcionamiento de la comunicaci{\'o}n verbal humana y tiene un fuerte potencial de transferencia para fines aplicados.},

The two dominant taxonomies are Vendler's accomplishments, achievements, activities, and states, adapted with substantial modifications by Dowty; and the tripartition into events, processes, and states by, for example, Mourelatos and Bach. This contribution focuses on the aspectually relevant properties lexicalized in (root) verbs (e.g., change-of-state, temporal extent, limit or boundary of some sort, incrementality, scalarity) and their relation to aspectual classes. The properties have grammatical consequences showing that they are lexicalized in overlapping clusters which characterize aspectual classes that are not neatly aligned with either of the dominant taxonomies. They influence the ways in which verbs are integrated into complex predicates and their aspectual class. Krifka's mereological approach to aspectual composition provided a foundation for much of the work on (non-)compositional processes that motivate the aspectual interpretation of complex predicates.},

  abstract = {Trying to uncover the roots of human speech and language has been the premier motivation to study the signalling behaviour of nonhuman primates for several decades. Focussing on the question of whether we find evidence for linguistic reference in the production of nonhuman primate vocalizations, I will first discuss how the criteria used to diagnose referential signalling have changed over time, and will then turn to the paradigmatic case of semantic communication in animals, the alarm calls of vervet monkeys, Chlorocebus pygerythrus. A recent in-depth analysis of the original material revealed that, while the alarm calls could be well distinguished, calls of similar structure were also used in withinand between-group aggression. This finding is difficult to reconcile with the idea that calls denote objects in the environment. Furthermore, nonhuman primates show only minimal signs of vocal production learning, one key prerequisite for conventionalized and symbolic communication. In addition, the structure of calls in different populations or closely related species is highly conserved. In conclusion, any continuity between nonhuman primate and human communication appears to be found at the level of the processing of signals. Why and how the ancestors of our own species one day began to talk to each other continues to be an enigma. Future research should focus on changes in the neural structure supporting volitional control over vocalizations, the gene networks associated with vocal production, and the developmental processes involved in the integration of production and perception of vocalizations.},

  abstract = {The post-genomic era is an exciting time for researchers interested in the biology of speech and language. Substantive advances in molecular methodologies have opened up entire vistas of investigation that were not previously possible, or in some cases even imagined. Speculations concerning the origins of human cognitive traits are being transformed into empirically addressable questions, generating specific hypotheses that can be explicitly tested using data collected from both the natural world and experimental settings. In this article, I discuss a number of promising lines of research in this area. For example, the field has begun to identify genes implicated in speech and language skills, including not just disorders but also the normal range of abilities. Such genes provide powerful entry points for gaining insights into neural bases and evolutionary origins, using sophisticated experimental tools from molecular neuroscience and developmental neurobiology. At the same time, sequencing of ancient hominin genomes is giving us an unprecedented view of the molecular genetic changes that have occurred during the evolution of our species. Synthesis of data from these complementary sources offers an opportunity to robustly evaluate alternative accounts of language evolution. Of course, this endeavour remains challenging on many fronts, as I also highlight in the article. Nonetheless, such an integrated approach holds great potential for untangling the complexities of the capacities that make us human.},

  abstract = {The study of language evolution, and human cognitive evolution more generally, has often been ridiculed as unscientific, but in fact it differs little from many other disciplines that investigate past events, such as geology or cosmology. Well-crafted models of language evolution make numerous testable hypotheses, and if the principles of strong inference (simultaneous testing of multiple plausible hypotheses) are adopted, there is an increasing amount of relevant data allowing empirical evaluation of such models. The articles in this special issue provide a concise overview of current models of language evolution, emphasizing the testable predictions that they make, along with overviews of the many sources of data available to test them (emphasizing comparative, neural, and genetic data). The key challenge facing the study of language evolution is not a lack of data, but rather a weak commitment to hypothesistesting approaches and strong inference, exacerbated by the broad and highly interdisciplinary nature of the relevant data. This introduction offers an overview of the field, and a summary of what needed to evolve to provide our species with language-ready brains. It then briefly discusses different contemporary models of language evolution, followed by an overview of different sources of data to test these models. I conclude with my own multistage model of how different components of language could have evolved.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes an architecture for the mapping between syntax and phonology -- in particular, that aspect of phonology that determines the linear ordering of words. We propose that linearization is restricted in two key ways. (1) the relative ordering of words is fixed at the end of each phase, or ``Spell-out domain''; and (2) ordering established in an earlier phase may not be revised or contradicted in a later phase. As a consequence, overt extraction out of a phase P may apply only if the result leaves unchanged the precedence relations established in P. We argue first that this architecture (``cyclic linearization'') gives us a means of understanding the reasons for successive-cyclic movement. We then turn our attention to more specific predictions of the proposal: in particular, the e¤ects of Holmberg's Generalization on Scandinavian Object Shift; and also the Inverse Holmberg Effects found in Scandinavian ``Quantifier Movement'' constructions (Ro{\textasciidieresis}gnvaldsson (1987); Jo{\textasciiacute}nsson (1996); Svenonius (2000)) and in Korean scrambling configurations (Ko (2003, 2004)). The cyclic linearization proposal makes predictions that cross-cut the details of particular syntactic configurations. For example, whether an apparent case of verb fronting results from V-to-C movement or from ``remnant movement'' of a VP whose complements have been removed by other processes, the verb should still be required to precede its complements after fronting if it preceded them before fronting according to an ordering established at an earlier phase. We argue that ``cross-construction'' consistency of this sort is in fact found.},

Instead, by making the assumption that speakers choose their words to be informative in context, listeners routinely make pragmatic inferences that go beyond the linguistic data. If language learners make these same assumptions, they should be able to infer word meanings in otherwise ambiguous situations. We use probabilistic tools to formalize these kinds of informativeness inferences---extending a model of pragmatic language comprehension to the acquisition setting---and present four experiments whose data suggest that preschool children can use informativeness to infer word meanings and that adult judgments track quantitatively with informativeness.},

  abstract = {We present an analysis of an understudied construction found in Philadelphian and Canadian English, and also in certain Vermont varieties. In this construction, the participle of certain verbs can appear along with a form of the verb               be               and a DP complement, producing strings like               I'm done my homework               ,               I'm finished my fries               , and (in Vermont)               I'm started the project               . We show that the participle in the construction is an adjectival passive, not a perfect construction. We further argue that the internal argument DP in the construction is receiving Case from the adjectival head               a               , similar to what happens in all English dialects with the adjective               worth               , and that the internal argument is interpreted via a mechanism of complement coercion. The microparametric variation we find across English dialects with respect to the availability of this construction is accounted for by variation in the selectional restrictions on the               a               head.},

In particular, their verbal behaviour is evidenced by the restricted availability of manner and other event-related modifiers. I propose that German adjectival participles denote degrees (state kinds), which accounts for their adjectival behaviour, and that an adjectival passive construction refers to the instantiation of a consequent state kind of an event kind, which accounts for the verbal properties. Event-related modifiers that name event participants, i.e. phrases headed by by or with, are analysed in terms of pseudo-incorporation. This account is motivated by the fact that the nouns in such phrases display properties of pseudo-incorporated nouns, such as discourse opacity and the requirement of naming an institutionalised or conventionalised activity or state, together with the verb/participle these phrases incorporate into. The restrictions on event-related modification, then, follow from general restrictions on kind modification and on pseudo-incorporation.},

  abstract = {This paper investigates the morphosyntax of resumption in Igbo (Benue-Congo). The first part addresses the syntax and argues that Igbo has two types of resumptive pronouns (RPs): (i) RPs that terminate base-generation A{\textasciimacron} -dependencies, and (ii) RPs at the bottom of A{\textasciimacron} -movement dependencies. While similar splits have been claimed to exist in a few other languages, established with a limited data set, Igbo provides pervasive evidence for the co-existence of both types within the same language: type-(ii) RPs occur in all A{\textasciimacron} -movement dependencies, and there is comprehensive evidence from a variety of movement tests, including also cyclicity effects, parasitic gap licensing, and language-specific diagnostics. We pursue a spell-out approach to type(ii) RPs {\`a} la Pesetsky (1998) and Landau (2006), and discuss potential reasons behind their restricted distribution: type-(ii) RPs only surface in PPs, DPs, and \&Ps, which are thus not (absolute) islands in Igbo. The second part of the paper deals with the morphological side of resumption, viz., with phi- and (alleged) case mismatches between the RP and its antecedent. The phi-mismatch provides further evidence for two types of RPs in Igbo. Moreover, it is more complex than the mismatches reported so far in the literature since the loss of phi-information depends on the type of antecedent (pro/noun, coordination). This pattern poses a challenge for previous accounts of phi-mismatches with movement-derived RPs that are based on static deletion domains. We propose that the cross-linguistic variation in phi-mismatches can be captured in a partial copy deletion approach along the lines of van Urk (2018) if the amount of structure that is deleted is defined dynamically. This further supports the relevance of dynamic domains in morphosyntax, in particular in postsyntactic operations, as previously identified in other areas, e.g., in Moskal's (2015b) work on contextual allomorphy. Finally, we show that the ``case'' mismatch is a consequence of the (supra)segmental nature of the relevant exponent and the relative timing of the operations involved.},

Drawing on a corpus of examples gathered from natural speech, written texts, and television scripts, we show that CR restricts the interpretation of the copied element to a `real' or prototypical reading. Turning to the structural properties of the construction, we show that CR is unusual among reduplication phenomena in that whole idioms can be copied, object pronouns are often copied (as in the second example above), and inflectional morphology need not be copied. Thus the `scope' of CR cannot be defined in purely phonological terms; rather, a combination of phonological, morphosyntactic, syntactic, and lexical factors is involved. We develop an analysis within the parallel architecture framework of Jackendoff (1997, 2002), whereby CR is treated as a lexical item with syntactic and semantic content and reduplicative phonology. We then sketch an alternative analysis, based on current assumptions within the Minimalist Program, which involves movement into a focus-like position with both the head and the tail of the resulting chain spelled out.},

  abstract = {This paper explores the trade-off between cognitive effort and cognitive effects during immediate metaphor comprehension. We specifically evaluate the fundamental claim of relevance theory that metaphor understanding, like all utterance interpretation, is constrained by the presumption of optimal relevance (Sperber and Wilson, 1995, p. 270): the ostensive stimulus is relevant enough for it to be worth the addressee's effort to process it, and the ostensive stimulus is the most relevant one compatible with the communicator's abilities and preferences. One important implication of optimal relevance is that listeners follow a path of least effort and stop processing at the first interpretation that satisfies their expectation of relevance. They do this by trying to minimize cognitive effort while maximizing cognitive effects. Some relevance theory scholars suggest that metaphors should require additional cognitive effort to be understood, and that in return they yield more cognitive effects than does literal speech. Others claim that metaphors may be understood quickly, as soon as people infer enough effects for the speaker's utterance to meet their expectation of optimal relevance. Our analysis of the experimental evidence suggests that there is no systematic relationship between cognitive effort and cognitive effects in metaphor comprehension. We conclude that relevance theory need not make any general predictions about the effort needed to comprehend metaphors. Nevertheless, relevance theory is consistent with many of the findings in psycholinguistics on metaphor understanding, and can account for aspects of metaphor understanding that no other theory can explain.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The origins of human language remains a major question in evolutionary science. Unique to human language is the capacity to flexibly recombine a limited sound set into words and hierarchical sequences, generating endlessly new sentences. In contrast, sequence production of other animals appears limited, stunting meaning generation potential. However, studies have rarely quantified flexibility and structure of vocal sequence production across the whole repertoire. Here, we used such an approach to examine the structure of vocal sequences in chimpanzees, known to combine calls used singly into longer sequences. Focusing on the structure of vocal sequences, we analysed 4826 recordings of 46 wild adult chimpanzees from Ta{\"i} National Park. Chimpanzees produced 390 unique vocal sequences. Most vocal units emitted singly were also emitted in two-unit sequences (bigrams), which in turn were embedded into three-unit sequences (trigrams). Bigrams showed positional and transitional regularities within trigrams with certain bigrams predictably occurring in either head or tail positions in trigrams, and predictably co-occurring with specific other units. From a purely structural perspective, the capacity to organize single units into structured sequences offers a versatile system potentially suitable for expansive meaning generation. Further research must show to what extent these structural sequences signal predictable meanings.},

  abstract = {An interpretation is given of John Dewey's views about ``realism'' in metaphysics, and of how these views relate to contemporary debates. Dewey rejected standard formulations of realism as a general metaphysical position, and interpreters have often been taken him to be sympathetic to some form of verificationism or constructivism. I argue that these interpretations are mistaken, as Dewey's unease with standard formulations of realism comes from his philosophical emphasis on intelligent control of events, by means of ordinary action. Because of his views about relations, Dewey's views in this area do risk collapsing into an overly holistic position. I discuss how these problems might be avoided, and consider also how Dewey's views about naturalism and realism might usefully inform ongoing work.},

  abstract = {Previous research indicates severe disabilities in processing figurative language in people diagnosed on the autism spectrum disorders. However, this aspect of language comprehension in Asperger syndrome (AS) specifically has rarely been the subject of formal study. The present study aimed to examine the possibility that in addition to their pragmatic deficits, the difficulties in the comprehension of metaphors in AS may be explained by deficient linguistic information processing. Specifically, we aimed to examine whether a deficient semantic integration process underlies the difficulties in metaphor comprehension frequently experienced by persons with AS. The semantic integration process of sixteen AS participants and sixteen matched controls was examined using event related potentials (ERPs). N400 amplitude served as an index for degree of effort invested in the semantic integration process of two-word expressions denoting literal, conventional metaphoric, and novel metaphoric meaning, as well as unrelated word pairs. Large N400 amplitudes for both novel and conventional metaphors demonstrated the greater difficulties in metaphor comprehension in the AS participants as compared to controls. Findings suggest that differences in linguistic information processing cause difficulties in metaphor comprehension in AS. {\'O} 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

It states that each utterance in a coherent discourse segment contains a single semantic entity---the backward-looking center---that provides a link to the previous utterance, and an ordered set of entities---the forward-looking centers---that offer potential links to the next utterance. We report five reading-time experiments that test predictions of this theory with respect to the conditions under which it is preferable to realize (refer to) on entity using a pronoun rather thon o repeated definite description or name. The experiments show that there is a single backward-looking center that is preferentially realized as a pronoun, and that the backward-looking center is typically realized as the grammatical subject of the utterance. They also provide evidence that there is a set of forward-looking centers that is ranked in terms of prominence, and that a key factor in determining prominence---surface-initial position---does not affect determination of the backward-looking center. This provides evidence for the dissociation of the coherence processes of looking backward and looking forward.},

Permuting the prioritization of constraints on a language-specific basis generates a factorial typology of phonological patterns. Patterns generated by an optimality-theoretic account can be compared with the set of attested patterns found in languages of the world to determine how well the analysis fits the observed typology. The typological predictions of OT are constrained to a large extent by the grounding of markedness constraints in independent facts about speech articulation, perception, and processing. Nevertheless, comprehensive typological analyses within OT commonly overpredict the existence of apparently unattested patterns. These cases of overgeneration may stem from several sources: they may be pathologic, may reflect accidental gaps due to the paucity of a given phenomenon, or may be grounded in diachronic biases in speech perception or production. The phonetic underpinnings and factorial typology of three phenomena are discussed in this article: syllable structure, the distribution of contour tones, and the loci of laryngeal neutralization.},

This bound pronoun effect holds across a wide range of phenomena including too/ enough-movement, tough-movement, gapping, comparative deletion, antecedent-contained deletion, quantifier scope interaction, multiple questions, pseudogapping, reciprocal binding, and multiple sluicing; we confirm the effect via a sentence acceptability experiment targeting some of these phenomena. Our account has two crucial ingredients: (a) bound pronouns optionally enter the derivation with unvalued ␾features and (b) phases are defined in part by convergence, so that under certain conditions, unvalued features void the phasal status of CP and extend the locality domain for syntactic operations.},

The English modals have played an important role in both synchronic and diachronic linguistic work in the last decades, but a number of contested issues concerning their development remain unresolved. This dissertation attempts to answer some of the open questions through careful analysis of the extant Old and Middle English sources and comparison with other Germanic languages, such as Old Norse, Middle Danish, and Middle Dutch.00The first part of the book provides a theoretical and methodological introduction to the study of the early English modals, the semantics of modality, and the historical corpora and other textual sources used for the investigation. The second part presents the investigation itself, which consists of four interconnected studies on the development of the modals, focussing on various morphological and syntactic developments in Middle English, the numerous changes to the ?marginal? modal dare, and the semantic development of the ?core? modals can, may, and must. I pay particular attention to a number of changes which do not follow the predictions made in the grammaticalization literature, but which can be readily explained with reference to analogy.0},

Other studies are comparative, and treat the Kurdish language area in its entirety.

The present volume is the first of its kind in bringing together contributions from a relatively large number of linguists, working in a diverse range of frameworks and on different aspects and varieties of Kurdish. As such, it attests to the increasing breadth and sophistication now evident in Kurdish linguistics, and is a worthy launch for the new series Bamberg Studies in Kurdish Linguistics (BSKL).},

The consensus in the theoretical literature on Hebrew has been that the object marker et is only licensed in the context of definite DPs. We observe, however, that in Modern Hebrew partitive nominals may also be preceded by et. Using a judgment task, we asked 41 native Hebrew-speaking adults to rate sentences with et-marked partitive object DPs on a 5-point acceptability scale.Our results reveal that partitive items received a considerably high acceptance score, with an overall average of 3.6/5. In addition, we found a main effect for object-position and quantifier-type. In particular, acceptability of et-marked partitives increased significantly for preposed DPs and for DPs that contained proportional quantifiers (as opposed to cardinals).The optional acceptability of et-marked partitives ostensibly challenges the generally accepted view, according to which the distribution of et is categorically determined based on the two-way +/--definiteness opposition. We put forth a formal syntactic analysis that reconciles our findings with the definiteness approach.},

I show that this puzzling behavior, originally discussed in Bhatt (1999, Covert modality in non-finite contexts) for the ability modal, extends to all modal auxiliaries with a circumstantial modal base (i.e., root modals), while epistemic interpretations of the same modals are immune to the effect. I propose that implicative readings are contingent on the relative position of the modal w.r.t. aspect: when aspect scopes over the modal (as I argue is the case for root modals), it forces an actual event, thereby yielding an implicative reading. When a modal element scopes over aspect, no actual event is forced. This happens (i) with epistemics, which structurally appear above tense and aspect; (ii) with imperfective on a root modal: imperfective brings in an additional layer of modality, itself responsible for removing the necessity for an actual event. This proposal enables us to solve the puzzle while maintaining a standardized semantics for aspects and modals.},

  abstract = {It is well known that languages are not necessarily consistent in their alignment, i.e. whether they are ergative or accusative. For example, the morphology may be ergative while the syntax is accusative. Mismatches of this kind led Anderson (1976, 1977) to the conclusion that ergativity is a superficial phenomenon, largely confined to the morphology, with no further consequences for the syntax. His standpoint was sharply criticized by other scholars who insisted that the presence of ergativity was a significant indicator of a language's typological profile. But in more recent work, e.g. Dixon (1994), it is also claimed that the presence of ergativity in some domain of the grammar need not have any further consequences for the grammar as a whole, hence to a certain extent reaffirming Anderson's standpoint and furthermore casting doubt on the validity of alignment as a typological parameter. In this study I present a detailed analysis of ergativity in Kurdish and demonstrate that in Kurdish, ergativity is indeed a relatively superficial phenomenon without further consequences for other levels of grammatical organization. Hence the usefulness of alignment as a typological parameter is questionable. Kurdish data is presented on morphological alignment, several syntactic processes, and voice phenomena. Finally, evidence from the loss of ergativity in Kurdish (Dorleijn, 1996) is discussed which is seen to provide further support for my claims.},

Census using responses from 2.3 million immigrants with Spanish or Chinese language backgrounds. The analyses tested a key prediction of the hypothesis, namely, that there would be a marked difference in the line regressing second language attainment on age of immigration on either side of the critical age point. Predictions tested were that there would be a difference in slope and/or a difference in the mean while controlling for slope. The results showed large linear effects for level of education and for age of immigration, but a negligible amount of additional variance was accounted for when the parameters for difference in slope and difference in means were estimated. Thus, the pattern of decline in second language acquisition failed to produce the necessary discontinuity that is an essential hallmark of a critical period.},

  abstract = {This paper examines the conditions for differential object marking (DOM) on partitive constructions in Eastern Armenian. Previous analyses of Eastern Armenian have treated differential object marking as a case-licensing operation that is sensitive to specificity and causes marked objects to have a distinct syntactic position outside the lower verbal domain. The present work offers newly-considered data involving partitive constructions, which show patterns of ``obligatory'' differential marking that do not correspond to specificity. Also included are data containing animate objects whose morphology provides additional evidence that specificity marking and DOM are non-trivially distinct. This paper offers an analysis of DOM in line with recent proposals in the literature and maintains that a discourse-related feature [PERSON] or [PARTICIPANT] in D{$^\circ$} requires a distinct licenser and distinguishes DOM from other case licensing operations such as that which licenses KP. Although various conditions have been discussed for why this [PERSON] feature may get merged in the DP, this paper adds to the discussion of DOM by considering the internal structure of partitives. If on the right track, the decomposed partitive DP presented here (which contains a special co-indexing relation between the subset and superset elements within the partitive) may offer a formal/syntactic explanation for how/why such a [PERSON] feature shows up in all partitives, regardless of specificity. If correct, this approach might formally account for the conditions that give rise to a number of instances of obligatory DOM in Eastern Armenian, in addition to providing support for the existence of distinct discourse-related licenser in the syntax.},

We argue for an analysis using Tree Adjoining Grammar (TAG) that captures the best of both approaches. We use TreeLocal Multi-Component Tree Adjoining Grammar to propose a syntax of it-clefts and Synchronous Tree Adjoining Grammar (STAG) to define a compositional semantics on the proposed syntax. It will be shown that the distinction TAG makes between the derivation tree and the derived tree, the extended domain of locality characterizing TAG and the direct syntax--semantics mapping characterizing STAG allow for a simple and straightforward account of the syntax and semantics of it-clefts, capturing the insights and arguments of both the expletive and the discontinuous constituent approaches. Our analysis reduces the syntax and semantics of it-clefts to copular sentences containing definite description subjects, such as `The person that won is Ohno'. We show that this is a welcome result, as evidenced by the syntactic and semantic similarities between it-clefts and the corresponding copular sentences.},

  abstract = {True clitic doubling involves multiple expression of a single argument in different structural positions. In clitic doubling configurations of this kind, a clitic expresses features of its full nominal phrase associate in argument position. True clitic doubling has traditionally been argued to arise via agreement, so that the clitic is the manifestation of an agreement relation between a verb and the associate. However, another possibility exists: the clitic could be a (pro)nominal element related to the associate via movement; then, clitic doubling involves the simultaneous realization of both the head and the foot of a movement chain. Here, I argue for the latter analysis, showing that true clitic doubling, at least in Bulgarian, has the properties of movement---i.e., it does not involve agreement, as is standardly assumed for this language. I provide support for this claim by considering a number of diagnostics which distinguish between clitics that reflect agreement processes and clitics that do not. Specifically, I argue that the clitic is a reduced articulation of the higher occurrence of a raised object. Thus, the proposed analysis treats clitic doubling as an interface phenomenon which results from the interaction of two independently motivated operations of the syntactic and morphophonological components of grammar: A-movement and morphological merger.},

  address = {Cambridge, Massachusetts},
  abstract = {While the notion of "subject" as a primitive of grammar is in some way encoded in mast modern syntactic theories, the c!.uster of syntactic properties attributed to subjects is not a homogenous one. This thesis aims to precisely characterize certain of these properties, partially through an invesiigation of constructions where they fail to converge. Two of these properties are of particular interest. First, the structural properties associated with "external arguments" are examined. that is, the question of where thematic sub-jects(as opposed to clausal subjects) are base-generated. Drawing on evidence from Japanese lexical causatives, a "split-.VP" structure is argued for, in which external arguments (Agents, Causers) are generated in the specifier of a projection which marks the introduction of an event argument (hence termed EventP). Below EventP are case-checking positions for underlying objects and indirect objects (internal argilrnents) as well as the projection in which intert,al arguments are base-generated ("BaseP"). "Verbs" on this approach consist of a "Base" head in combination with an "Event" head, and the decomposition of verbal meaning into "primitives" such as CAUSE, HAVE or BE is assumed. In support, a correlation IS drawn between the existence of the predicate "have" in a language and the possibility of a double objectldouble complement alternation, adducing evidence from Irish, Tagalog and Dini, as well as Japanese, Georgian and English. Secondly, the question of morphological nominative case is considered. Nominative marking on an NP is typically taken to be an indicator of subjecthood, nonetheless, there are constructions ir! which a nominative-marked argument appears to be in object position. Such nominative objects in Icelandic are examined in detail, and a mechanism for assigning morphological case is proposed which modifies standard assumptions about the strict connection of morphological case with structural position. Given such modification, the question of NP-licensing is re-examined, with an eye to dispensing with abstract case entirely; the apparent effects of abstract case assignment (and, incidentally, Buzio's Generalization) are seen to be the result of the interaction of the mechanism governing morphological case assignment with the Extended Projection Principle.},

The interaction of applicative and causative morphology, the existence of two kinds of causatives, and the interaction of passive and verbalizing morphology show that the external-argument introducing projection VoiceP (Kratzer, 1996) must be distinct from the verbalizing head vP (Marantz, 1997), as first proposed by Pylkk{\"a}nen (2002) and subsequently by Cuervo (2003), Collins (2005), Alexiadou et al. (2006), Merchant (2008) and Harley (2009), among many others. This result stands in opposition to earlier proposals in which a single projection, vP, serves both to verbalize and to introduce the external argument, as in Chomsky (1995), Marantz (1997), and Harley (1995). It also challenges the conclusions of Coon and Preminger (2010), who give explicit arguments for the identity of external-argument-introducing Voice and verbalizing v.},

We argue that the small clause analysis proposed by Harley (1995, 2002) in fact makes correct predictions in all these cases. In addition, we point out the existence of previously overlooked parallels between double object structures and have-sentences with respect to depictives, eventive DP complements, and quantifier scope.

Pylkk{\"a}nen proposed a ``bundling'' parameter: some languages project a single bundled Voice/vP, and all functions depend on that single projection, and others project VoiceP and vP separately, and functions are distributed. The chapter first reviews the roles ascribed to these projections: (i) external argument introduction, (ii) event argument introduction, (iii) accusative case checking, (iv) introduction of causative or inchoative semantics, (v) verbalizing of nonverbal material, and (vi) demarcating a cycle. The chapter then reviews support for Pylkk{\"a}nen's parametric view of Voice-bundling from, e.g., Hiaki, Turkish, Korean, and English. Results on causatives from Key (2013) and Jung (2014) suggest that the projection sequence dominating v may form part of a predetermined projection hierarchy. The constraint against stacking productive morphological causatives may thus be attributed to the extended verbal projection.},

We conclude that Thai data supports the equative approach. The paper is organized as follows. We first introduce the inverse and equative analyses, and provide a little background on Thai. We then discuss our sentence acceptability task survey, and introduce the idea that the test items in the survey may have been subject to type-shifting.

A cleft sentence divides a proposition into two parts, which are interpreted as an exhaustive focus and a pragmatic presupposition.

Clefts thus introduce a cleft focus or even a pair of foci constructionally. They also exhibit an assertive (comment) focus, which may or may not correspond to the cleft focus. While only exclusive focus particles can associate with the cleft focus, additive and scalar focus particles can associate with the assertive focus in the cleft clause, thus giving rise to additional cleft sentences containing multiple instances of focus.},

What is at issue is whether the best golfer in the first sentence moves to Spec,CP or Spec,TP. Using an analysis of specificational nominals developed by Nishiyama (2003, 2000), we argue that English specificational sentences also have two readings, the D-reading and the R-reading, which account for past debates regarding the landing site of inverse nominals. We argue that both Spec,CP (and ultimately FocP) and Spec,TP are available to the inverted nominal, depending on the reading. We then extend this analysis to Japanese and consider apparent counterevidence from Mikkelsen's (2005) analysis of Danish. Finally, we draw important parallels between inverted copular sentences and the two types of specificational pseudoclefts discussed in Den Dikken, Meinunger, \& Wilder (2000).},

We begin by presenting a revised analysis of the copula-construction analysis of Hatakeyama (1997), positing movement of the copula verb to Fin0, instead of C0. We then consider cases of copula omission which are internal to the second clause of comparative correlative constructions, such as in the more difficult the problem (is), the more tired the student (is). We argue that the copula in these sentences moves to Fin0, and subsequently undergoes PF ellipsis. We further extend this analysis of the copula to the copula that sits in between the clauses in comparative correlatives (e.g. the more we eat is the happier we become), which is optionally overt in Jamaican English but covert in Standard English. We argue that this second case of the copula undergoes exactly the same syntactic operation as the first, moving to Fin0. We thus establish that comparative correlatives derive from a predication built from the so-called reversed comparative correlative (e.g. We become happier the more we eat), using den Dikken's (2006) predicate-inversion analysis and its null functional head. Overall, we argue that the comparative correlative is, from a larger perspective, an inverse copula construction.},

I propose a syntax-prosody mapping algorithm that derives intonational phrase boundaries from the surface syntax, and then argue that each alternation can be understood in terms of output optimization (Mascar{\'o} 2007; Mester 1994). The important fact is that K'ichee' requires a prominence peak rightmost in the intonational phrase, and so the morphological alternations occur in order to ensure an optimal host for this prominence peak. Finally, I consider the wider implications of the analysis for the architecture of the syntax-phonology interface, especially as it concerns late-insertion theories of morphology (Anderson 1982, 1992; Embick and Noyer 2001; Halle and Marantz 1993; Hayes 1990, among others). The primary result is that late lexical insertion must occur at least as late as the construction of intonational phrases.},

  abstract = {This paper examines genitive subjects in relative constructions in Polynesian languages, with a focus on Niuean and Maori. In these languages, the subject of a relative clause may optionally be expressed as a genitive, appearing outside the relative clause, akin to English examples such as ``his book to read''. The construction is compared to similar ones in Altaic languages, with a key difference being that in the Polynesian examples, genitive case clearly originates outside the relative clause. The question arises as to how the genitive nominal relates to its assumed theta position inside the relative clause. Arguments are presented against a raising and a control analysis. Instead, it is posited that the genitive nominal is externally merged outside the relative clause, forming a constituent with the entire relative construction, not with the relative clause, nor with the head of the relative clause. The genitive nominal receives its theta role in this external position through a process of semantic control directly of a theta feature within the lexical predicate in the relative clause. A remaining issue is that the relative clause does not appear to be reduced in Polynesian languages, as it more clearly is in similar constructions in Altaic languages. {\ss} 2011 Elsevier B.V.

A specific NP indicates that it is referentially anchored to another discourse object. This means that the referent of the specific expression is linked by a contextually salient function to the referent of another expression.},

  abstract = {The paper discusses the conditions for case marking on partitive constructions in direct object position in Turkish and some related languages. We focus on Turkish and then turn to some details of corresponding constructions in some other Turkic languages and in Standard Mongolian. Turkish exhibits Differential Object Marking, which primarily depends on the semantic-pragmatic factor of specificity. Partitive constructions with the ablative for the superset in Turkish come in different forms, depending on how the subset expression is realized: (a) by a lexical noun as head, (b) by the classifier tane `item', functioning as a ``dummy noun'', and (c) by a numeral, quantifier or adjective. Case marking of the direct object is optional for (a), and obligatory for (most instances of) (c). This type of obligatory case marking is dependent on the obligatory marking of the adjective, quantifier or numeral with a default 3rd person singular agreement suffix, which then requires case marking. Construction (b) does not allow for case marking, when the classifier is bare; when the classifier is followed by the default 3rd person singular agreement marking, that marking requires obligatory case morphology, just like in construction (c). We hypothesize that structural case marking can either express the semantic-pragmatic condition of specificity in terms of referential anchoring or it must obey a formal condition, namely the requirement of the agreement suffix to be followed by overt case. The languages we have studied show an interesting micro-variation. They differ (among other properties) with respect to classifiers -- in particular, with respect to whether they have [+human] classifiers or not. In addition, one language among the languages under investigation, namely Kirghiz, substitutes the agreement marker in its function as a filler of the partitive's nominal head by a different marker: a morpheme expressing a set. Here, the agreement marker is used to express specificity, given that its presence is not required for formal reasons. In direct object partitive constructions with subset expressions that are expressed as full noun phrase/lexical noun heads (option (a) above), overt accusative case indicates specificity in most of the investigated languages. In options (b) and (c), the investigated languages provide different patterns when marking the referential status of the partitive heads, thus indicating the variation among these languages with respect to the nominal category feature of the partitive heads involved.This article is part of the Special Collection:~Partitives},

Two hypotheses are compared with regard to the predictions they make for Finnish null subject constructions: (A) Agr is interpretable in null subject languages, and pro is therefore redundant; (B) null subjects are specified but unpronounced pronouns that assign values to the uninterpretable features of Agr. Since Finnish observes the Extended Projection Principle and has an expletive pronoun, Hypothesis A predicts that null subjects should cooccur with expletives. The prediction is false, favoring B over A. A typology of null subjects is proposed: Null bound pronouns and null generic pronouns in partial null subject languages, including Finnish, are D-less {$\varphi$}, and so are null subjects in consistent null subject languages with Agr, such as Spanish and Greek. Null 1st and 2nd person subjects in Finnish are DPs that are deleted. Null pronouns in languages without Agr, such as Chinese and Japanese, are the only true instances of pro, a minimally specified null noun.},

  abstract = {This classic study in theoretical and Chinese syntax has proven influential in recent developments of syntactic theory in areas as diverse as phrase structure, quantifier scope, anaphora, movement constraints, the form and meaning of interrogative sentences, and the nature of Logical Form. Huang gives a derailed analysis of a wide range of grammatical constructions in Chinese (and English) and shows that his analyses shed important new light on the theory of Universal Grammar and linguistic typology, often in ways unavailable from the study of English and other familiar European languages. Some of the results of this work are: (a) a parametric theory of quantifier scope; (b) a relativized notion of a 'governing category' for Chomsky's (1981) binding theory; (c) a theory of generalized control that derives the pro drop parameter and related phenomena; (d) a proposed Condition on Extraction Domains (CED) on overt movement; (e) a proposal of LF wh-movement for languages without wh-movement; and (f) a generalization of the ECP to account for a full range of adjunct/ complement asymmetries and subject/object asymmetries in syntactic and LF extraction. The proposed analyses exemplify how an optimal theory of typology should come about as the 'by-product' of an optimal theory of UG.},

  abstract = {In this paper I argue for a property-driven approach to phonological typology. Rather than seeking to classify or label languages, the central goal of phonological typology is to determine how different languages systematize the phonetic substance available to all languages. The paper focuses on a very murky area in phonological typology, word-prosodic systems. While there is agreement that certain properties converge to characterize two prosodic prototypes, tone and stress, the term ``pitch-accent'' is frequently adopted to refer to a defective tone system whose tone is obligatory, culminative, privative, metrical, and/or restricted in distribution. Drawing from a database of ca. 600 tone systems, I show that none of these properties is found in all systems claimed to be accentual and that all five are amply attested in canonical tone systems. Since all one can say is that alleged pitch-accent systems exhibit significant constraints on the distribution of their tonal contrasts, they do not constitute a coherent prosodic ``type''. Rather, alleged ``pitch-accent'' systems freely pick-and-choose properties from the tone and stress prototypes, producing mixed, ambiguous, and sometimes analytically indeterminate systems which appear to be ``intermediate''. There thus is no pitch-accent prototype, nor can prosodic systems be treated as a continuum placed along a single linear dimension. The paper concludes that the goal of prosodic typology should not be to classify languages, but rather the properties of their subsystems.},

Here, we report that 25-month-old children are sensitive to cross-linguistically valid sound-symbolic matches in the domain of action and that this sound symbolism facilitates verb learning in young children. We constructed a set of novel soundsymbolic verbs whose sounds were judged to match certain actions better than others, as confirmed by adult Japanese- as well as English speakers, and by 2- and 3-year-old Japanese-speaking children. These sound-symbolic verbs, together with other novel nonsound-symbolic verbs, were used in a verb learning task with 3-year-old Japanese children. In line with the previous literature, 3-year-olds could not generalize the meaning of novel non-sound-symbolic verbs on the basis of the sameness of action. However, 3-year-olds could correctly generalize the meaning of novel sound-symbolic verbs. These results suggest that iconic scaffolding by means of sound symbolism plays an important role in early verb learning.},

I argue that current developments in the theory of locality in Distributed Morphology (Embick 2010, Marantz 2013) impose bound- aries on syntactic analysis and that morphemes cannot be identified and analyzed without studying their realization at the interfaces of syntax with both phonology and interpretation. The empirical focus is on a series of phenomena which are attested in Icelandic noun phrases and involve the realization of roots, category- defining heads, inflection morphemes, and definite articles, all of which may appear in the same noun as shown below. (1) leik-end-ur-nir 'play'-nmlz-m.nom.pl-def Three main components of the dissertation involve applicative structures, definite articles and morphophonology. I argue for the existence of applicatives in noun phrases which do not include a verbal substructure based on the realization of mor- phemes in an Icelandic Caused Experience construction. A study which compares definite articles in German and Icelandic supports the findings in Schwarz (2009) that there are two definite articles in natural language and the realization of the Icelandic articles has implications for the theory of suffixation under adjacency (Embick and Noyer 2001). These case studies, in addition to a series of smaller case studies, support the view that an analysis of one linguistic component may only be well-informed if it considers other interacting components as well. My method, to approach a well- defined empirical case, Icelandic nouns, with a precise theoretical framework like Distributed Morphology, yields valuable results. I show how many types of locality constraints interact in the same word and this is pleasing because it shows that the theory is not based on convenient but cross-linguistically isolated data sets. Rather, aspects of language like syntax, morphology and semantics are constantly interacting and they are best understood in the context of each other.},

The solution proposed builds on the idea of secondary licensing on the same DP, going back to Kayne's Generalization. The conclusion is that, at least in some languages, differential objects are classes that undergo an additional licensing operation.},

This paper contributes to this debate by examining a rather ignored equative (equality comparative) context where unexpected differential object marking is obligatory irrespective of its canonical features. The data come from Romance (taking Romanian as a representative sample) and one Indo-Aryan variety, namely Nepali. We show that such marking poses a challenge to most theories examining the precise nature of the identity condition in ellipsis and comparatives. The answer we propose follows mixed theories (M{\'a}rtin Gonz{\'a}lez 2016); crucially, we also show that (some types of) Case identity can be reduced to the requirement of certain structures to manipulate arguments instead of predicates (oftype). Our remarks are relevant to licensing of arguments and identity conditions that go beyond ellipsis.},

The implementational level complexity of a change, rather than its computational level complexity, may be more closely related to the plausibility of a discrete evolutionary event causing that change. Thus the formal complexity of a change at the computational level may not be a good guide to the plausibility of an evolutionary event introducing that change. For example, while the Minimalist Program's Merge is a simple formal operation (Berwick \& Chomsky, 2016), the computational mechanisms required to implement the language it generates (e.g., to parse the language) may be considerably more complex. This has implications for the theory of grammar: theories of grammar which involve several kinds of syntactic operations may be no less evolutionarily plausible than a theory of grammar that involves only one. A deeper understanding of human language at the algorithmic and implementational levels could strengthen Minimalist Program's account of the evolution of language.},

  abstract = {This paper explores the Persian Ezafe construction, a construction which has received significant attention in the syntactic literature in the past few decades. Descriptively, Ezafe is an unstressed vowel -e (-ye after vowels) which appears between a noun and its modifier (N-e Mod), and is repeated on subsequent modifiers, if they are present, except the last one (N-e Mod1-e Mod2-e Mod3). This paper takes a fresh look at the distribution of the Ezafe vowel, with a special emphasis on its correlation with the order of elements in the noun phrase. After the close connection between word order and the absence/presence of Ezafe is established, the paper considers alternative ways this relation can be captured and argues for a roll-up movement account of this construction, which takes the base order of the noun phrase in Persian to be head final, with the surface order derived via phrasal movement to specifiers of intermediate functional projections in a roll-up fashion. In developing and arguing for this analysis, we will also have a closer look at several constructions in Persian, such as the superlative and the colloquial definite marker, and will account for various word order restrictions in the Persian noun phrase.},

The paper builds on previous work on the distribution of the auxiliary in focus-neutral contexts (Kahnemuyipour \& Megerdoomian 2011), where its placement was analyzed as second position within the lower phase domain (or vP), thereby extending the inventory of known second-position phenomena from the clause to the smaller verbal domain. To account for the distribution of the auxiliary in sentences with focused constituents, it is proposed here that the relevant phase in this context is the Focus Phrase, with the auxiliary appearing in the expected second position. This falls into place under a dynamic view of phasehood that defines the phase as the highest projection of a lexical category and takes low focus to be part of the verbal domain and its corresponding phase (Bo skovi c 2014). These proposals rely highly on the parallelism between clausal and verbal domains both in terms of their status as phases as well as their structural makeup. To the extent that these proposals succeed in accounting for the facts we discuss, they provide further evidence for the dynamic conception of phases as well as the CP--vP parallelism.},

Overall, individuals with autism spectrum disorder showed poorer comprehension of figurative language than their typically developing peers (Hedges' g\,=\,--0.57). A meta-regression analysis showed that group matching strategy and types of figurative language were significantly related to differences in effect sizes, whereas chronological age and cross-linguistic differences were not. Differences between the autism spectrum disorder and typically developing groups were small and nonsignificant when the groups were matched based on the language ability. Metaphors were more difficult to comprehend for individuals with autism spectrum disorder compared with typically developing controls than were irony and sarcasm. Our findings highlight the critical role of core language skills in figurative language comprehension. Interventions and educational programmes designed to improve social communication skills in individuals with autism spectrum disorder may beneficially target core language skills in addition to social skills.},

A systematic search was undertaken in seven relevant databases. Fourteen studies fulfilled our predetermined inclusion criteria. Across tasks, we detected four types of response format and a great variety of metaphors in terms of familiarity, syntactic structure, and linguistic context. Individuals with TD outperformed individuals with ASD on metaphor comprehension (Hedges' g = -0.63). Verbal explanation response format was utilized in the study showing the largest effect size in the group comparison. However, due to the sparse experimental manipulations, the role of task properties could not be established. Future studies should consider and report task properties to determine their role in metaphor comprehension, and to inform experimental paradigms as well as educational assessment.},

  abstract = {I propose a novel analysis of differential object marking (DOM) that revolves around nominal licensing and, unlike most previous accounts, does not appeal to object visibility (e.g., Danon 2006, Lyutikova \& Pereltsvaig 2015), object raising (e.g., Bhatt \& Anagnostopoulou 1996, Baker \& Vinokurova 2010), or object differentiation or identification (e.g., Aissen 2003, De Hoop \& Malchukov 2008). I argue (i) that not all nominals need abstract licensing (following Massam 2001, Danon 2006, Ormazabal \& Romero 2013), but also that all nominals have the potential to be licensed, that is, all nominals are visible to case and agreement processes; (ii) that the set of objects that are overtly marked (e.g., by case or agreement) can reveal the set of nominals that require licensing in a language, and (iii) that clauses typically have one obligatory nominal licenser, with secondary licensers merging only when needed for convergence (following Levin \& Massam 1985; Bobaljik 1993; Laka 1993, 2000; Rezac 2011). Taken together, I show that variation in the types of nominals that need licensing and the location/identity of obligatory and secondary licensers can derive crosslinguistic differences in case, agreement, and DOM patterns. This unified account simplifies our understanding of nominal licensing within and across languages, as it does not require objects to have special properties as compared to subjects, nor does it fundamentally differentiate DOM languages from non-DOM languages. The motivating data come largely from the Neo-Aramaic language Senaya, which clearly illustrates that certain nominals can occupy a position where abstract licensing is unavailable.},

  abstract = {Indo-Iranian languages present several challenges for recent theoretical approaches to morphology (Halle \& Marantz 1993, et seq) and agreement/case splits (Coon 2010, ia). First, the Indo-Iranian verbal system revolves around two verb ``stems''---traditionally labeled the ``present stem'' and the ``past stem''---whose semantics are difficult to pin down, leading to the claim that the stems have a morphomic distribution, appearing in fixed constructions (Haig 2008). Second, the form of the stems is highly opaque and irregular, making decomposition into morphemes a challenge. Finally, these stems form the basis of various sorts of case and agreement splits, despite the lack of a clear syntactic or semantic trigger. In this paper we undertake a case study of one Indo-Iranian language, Ad{\i}yaman Kurmanji (AK), a dialect of Kurdish spoken in the town of Ad{\i}yaman in southeastern Turkey. We closely examine both the semantics and morphology of verb stems in AK, and argue that the above challenges are only apparent. In particular, we propose (i) a morphological analysis of these stems that opposes a/0-marked form (``present stem'') with an overtlysuffixed form (``past stem''), {\S} 2, and (ii) a semantic analysis of this morphology, with the null suffix as nonpast tense, and the overt suffix elsewhere (past tense, nonfinite tense), {\S} 3. This compositional analysis, combined with a variety of morphosyntactic evidence, leads us to several surprising observations. The puzzle we take up in detail in {\S} 4 is that T behaves morphologically and syntactically as though it were below Asp in AK. Two additional puzzles that we note but do not explore in detail are that AK exhibits an extremely rare morpheme order within the complex verb, Asp-V-Tns (Julien 2002), and that split ergativity in AK is conditioned by tense, which has been claimed to be unattested (Salanova 2007, Coon 2013). We explore various possible explanations for the special position and role of tense in AK, but ultimately leave these new puzzles open for further research.},

For example, a sentence such as `Some of the animals are safe to pet' can be interpreted as giving rise to the inference `Some and not all animals are safe to pet' when uttered by an expert. The same inference, known as a scalar implicature, does not arise when the sentence is spoken by someone with partial knowledge. Adults have been shown to derive scalar implicatures in accordance with the speaker's knowledge state, but in young children this ability is debated. Here, we revisit this question using a simple visual world paradigm. We find that both 4- and 5-year-olds successfully incorporate speaker knowledge into the derivation of scalar inferences. However, this ability does not generalize immediately to non-linguistic communicative contexts. These findings have important implications for the development of pragmatic abilities.},

We will specifically argue that the w-feature mismatch at the syntax--morphology interface is responsible for the emergence of the Person-Case Constraint (PCC) effects. Viewing the PCC from this perspective provides adequate grounds to account for the default agreement and focus movement as ways of circumventing the PCC in Kurdish. At an explanatory level this work presents corroborative evidence to conceive of the PCC as an epiphenomenon ensuing from the interplay of the more general principles at the syntax--morphology interface.},

I will specifically show that the ergative pattern as currently obtained in the grammatical structure of some Iranian languages has evolved from a periphrastic past participle construction, the analogue of which is attested in Old Persian. It will further be argued that the predecessor past participle construction imparted a resultative construal in Old Persian and, subsequently, in the transition to Middle Persian, has assumed a simple past reading. The bottom-line of the analysis will be represented as a proposal regarding the nature of the ergative verb, to the effect that an ergative verb, as opposed to a regular (non-ergative) transitive verb, is semantically transitive, but syntactically intransitive.},

Adducing evidence from a diverse array of structures that share formal characteristics with the past transitive structure in Kurdish, I will argue that ergativity emerges in transitive structures where (a) the transitive verb, subcategorizing for a complement DP, is defective in terms of accusative case assignment (i.e. unaccusative) and (b) the external argument, i.e. the subject DP, is licensed as the specifier of a high applicative head that takes vP as its complement. Thus analyzed, ergativity is construed as a natural computational corollary deriving from the interaction of independently motivated operations of the narrow syntax.},

Word order in Mande (disregarding the auxiliaries at this point) is S-O-V, with adverbs and oblique case objects following the verb. This structure has given rise to a number of questions concerning historical syntax, and the grammaticalization of the auxiliary elements.Iin the light of evidence from Central Mande, the possibility of a verbal origin (vs. non-verbal sources) of these elements is discussed in the present article. I shall argue that auxiliaries for TAM categories central to the systems (imperfective, perfective) cannot convincingly be shown to be derived from verbs. Conversely, there is reasonable evidence for a non-verbal origin of the perfective markers in the Manding dialect continuum, and beyond. In the view adopted here, the emergence of auxiliaries cannot be argued to have caused word order change in the early history of Mande.},

  abstract = {This paper develops a generalization about agreement in German copula constructions described in Coon et al. (2017), and proposes an analysis that ties it to other well-established hierarchy phenomena. Specifically, we show that ``assumed-identity'' copula constructions in German exibit both person and number hierarchy effects, and that these extend beyond the ``non-canonical'' or ``inverse'' agreement patterns described in previous work on copula constructions (see e.g. B{\'e}jar and Kahnemuyipour 2017 and works cited there). We present experimental evidence to support this generalization, and then develop an account that unifies it with hierarchy phenomena in other languages, with a focus on PCC effects. Specifically, we propose that what German copula constructions have in common with PCC environments is that there are multiple accessible DPs in the domain of a single agreement probe, the lower of which is more featurally specified than the higher (see, e.g., B{\'e}jar and Rezac 2003, 2009; Anagnostopoulou 2005; Nevins 2007). We also offer an explanation as to why number effects are present in German copula constructions but notably absent in PCC effects. We then place our account within the broader context of constraints on predication structures.},

Following Kornfilt (1996) I argue that there are two verbal forms in finite structures: one consists of a participle and a copula, which is inflected for tense and agreement, and the other is a fully inflected verbal form. I propose that the former is formed by a derivation in which the verb moves as far as a functional head such Aspect or Modal, creating a participle. A verbal feature (copula) is inserted at To satisfying its verbal requirement. In the latter case the verb moves all the way up to To. No copula is inserted.},

  abstract = {English uses the same prepositions to describe both spatial and temporal relationships (e.g., at the corner, at 1:30), and other languages worldwide exhibit similar patterns. These space--time parallelisms have been explained by the Metaphoric Mapping Theory, which maintains that humans have a cognitive predisposition to structure temporal concepts in terms of spatial schemas through the application of a TIME IS SPACE metaphor. Evidence comes from (among other sources) historical investigations showing that languages consistently develop in such a way that expressions that originally have only spatial meanings are gradually extended to take on analogous temporal meanings. It is not clear, however, if the metaphor actively influences the way that modern adults process prepositional meanings during language use. To explore this question, a series of experiments was conducted with four brain-damaged subjects with left perisylvian lesions. Two subjects exhibited the following dissociation: they failed a test that assesses knowledge of the spatial meanings of prepositions, but passed a test that assesses knowledge of the corresponding temporal meanings of the same prepositions. This result suggests that understanding the temporal meanings of prepositions does not necessarily require establishing structural alignments with their spatial correlates. Two other subjects exhibited the opposite dissociation: they performed better on the spatial test than on the temporal test. Overall, these findings support the view that although the spatial and temporal meanings of prepositions are historically linked by virtue of the TIME IS SPACE metaphor, they can be (and may normally be) represented and processed independently of each other in the brains of modern adults.},

  abstract = {Despite the increasingly interdisciplinary nature of the language sciences, so far relatively little effort has been devoted to exploring potential connections between typology and neuroscience. To illustrate some of the insights that can be gained from pursuing such an integration, this paper focuses on one of the most well established and frequently cited typological generalizations, namely that in the vast majority of human languages, the basic word order is either SOV (about 48\%) or SVO (about 41\%). It has been suggested that these strong tendencies can be explained cognitively in terms of the prototypical transitive action scenario, in which an animate agent acts forcefully on an inanimate patient to induce a change of state. Two forms of iconicity are especially relevant: first, because the agent is at the head of the causal chain that affects the patient, subjects usually precede objects; and second, because it is the agent's action, rather than the agent per se, that changes the state of the patient, verbs and objects are usually adjacent. The purpose of this paper is to show that this account converges with, and hence receives further support from, recent research on how actions are represented in the brain. Specifically, several lines of evidence are reviewed which suggest that Broca's area plays a pivotal role in schematically representing the sequential and hierarchical organization of goal-directed bodily movements, not only when they are performed and perceived in the real world, but also when they are conceptualized and symbolically expressed as transitive clauses. Taken together, these findings support the hypothesis that the most cross-linguistically prevalent word order patterns reflect the most natural ways of linearizing and nesting the core conceptual components of actions in Broca's area.},

We present the data of the Dutch Lexicon Project (DLP) in which a group of 39 participants made lexical decisions to 14,000 words and the same number of nonwords. To examine whether the extensive practice precludes comparison with the traditional short experiments, we look at the differences between the first and the last session, compare the results with the English Lexicon Project (ELP) and the French Lexicon Project (FLP), and examine to what extent established findings in Dutch psycholinguistics can be replicated in virtual experiments. Our results show that when good nonwords are used, practice effects are minimal in lexical decision experiments and do not invalidate the behavioral data. For instance, the word frequency curve is the same in DLP as in ELP and FLP. Also, the Dutch--English cognate effect is the same in DLP as in a previously published factorial experiment.This means that large-scale word recognition studies can make use of psychophysical and psychometrical approaches. In addition, our data represent an important collection of very long series of individual reaction times that may be of interest to researchers in other areas.},

The tableau of evidence is a large puzzle only a few pieces of which have been filled in. In this work, I present several of those pieces. Part 1 contains synchronic evidence of object marking patterns in various languages both inside and outside the proposed isogloss, while Part 2 contains the result of a study comparing object marking in Old Anatolian Turkish and Classical Persian manuscripts.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Quantificational determiners have meanings that are ``conservative'' in the following sense: in sentences, repeating a determiner's internal argument within its external argument is logically insignificant. Using a verification task to probe which sets (or properties) of entities are represented when participants evaluate sentences, we test the predictions of three potential explanations for the cross-linguistic yet substantive conservativity constraint. According to ``lexical restriction'' views, words like every express relations that are exhibited by pairs of sets, but only some of these relations can be expressed with determiners. An ``interface filtering'' view retains the relational conception of determiner meanings, while replacing appeal to lexical filters (on relations of the relevant type) with special rules for interpreting the combination of a quantificational expression (Det NP) with its syntactic context and a ban on meanings that lead to triviality. The contrasting idea of ``ordered predication'' is that determiners don't express genuine relations. Instead, the second argument provides the scope of a monadic quantifier, while the first argument selects the domain for that quantifier. On this view, a determiner's two arguments each have a different logical status, suggesting that they might have a different psychological status as well. We find evidence that this is the case: When evaluating sentences like every big circle is blue, participants mentally group the things specified by the determiner's first argument (e.g., the big circles) but not the things specified by the second argument (e.g., the blue things) or the intersection of both (e.g., the big blue circles). These results suggest that the phenomenon of conservativity is due to ordered predication.},

  abstract = {This afterword constructs a working typology of nominalizations, based on but not restricted to the papers collected in this special issue. The typology is based on what we call the Functional Nominalization Thesis (FNT), a version of the model of ``mixed projections'' proposed in Borsley and Kornfilt (2000) which claims that nominal properties of a nominalization are contributed by a nominal functional projection; above that projection the structure has nominal properties, below it, verbal properties. We argue for four possible levels of nominalization, CP, TP, vP and VP. We show that certain internal syntactic phenomena are characteristic of different levels of nominalization: genitive subjects of nominalization at TP and below, genitive objects of nominalization at vP and below. We suggest that the inventory of categories implicated in nominalization is quite restricted: D, and nominal counterparts of `light' verbal categories. We examine two alternatives to the FNT, the framework of Panagiotidis and Grohmann (2009) and Bresnan's (1997) head-sharing approach, and argue that our treatment is more appropriate under a minimalist approach, as it accommodates the facts within an independently motivated inventory of functional categories, without positing a special type of category limited only to nominalizations. We counter Bresnan's objections against a syntactic derivation of nominalizations by showing that a word's lexical integrity can be successfully violated by ``suspended affixation'' in syntactically derived nominalizations in Turkish while such integrity has to be respected in lexically derived nominalizations.},

Pesetsky (2000, Phrasal movement and its kin. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press) presents a comprehensive study of intervention effects in English multiple wh-questions, arguing that intervention correlates with superiority: superiority-violating questions are subject to intervention effects, while superiority-obeying questions are immune from such effects. This description has been adopted as an explanandum in most recent work on intervention, such as Beck (2006, Intervention effects follow from focus interpretation. Natural Language Semantics 14. 1--56) and Cable (2010, The Grammar of Q: Q-particles, wh-movement, and pied-piping. Oxford University Press), a.o. In this paper, I show instead that intervention effects in English questions correlate with the available LF positions for wh-in-situ and the intervener, but not with superiority. The grammar allows for several different ways of repairing intervention configurations, including wh-movement, scrambling, Quantifier Raising, and reconstruction. Intervention effects are observed when none of these repair strategies are applicable, and there is no way of avoiding the intervention configuration -- regardless of superiority. Nonetheless, I show that these results are consistent with the syntax proposed for English questions in Pesetsky (2000, Phrasal movement and its kin. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press) and with the semantic theory of intervention effects in Beck (2006, Intervention effects follow from focus interpretation. Natural Language Semantics 14. 1--56).},

  abstract = {Several scholars have proposed alternative views to conceptual metaphor theory (see, for example, Ortony, 1993; Barnden, 2006; Wilson and Carston, 2006, 2008; Vega, 2007; Gibbs, 2008). How are the modified, refined, and alternative theories related to each other and standard conceptual metaphor theory, and which theory provides the best account of the phenomenon of metaphor? The particular approaches I will consider in this paper include the theory of metaphor as categorization, standard conceptual metaphor theory, blending theory, the neural theory of metaphor, conceptual metaphor theory as based on the idea of main meaning focus, and relevance theory. I will present the various theories through the analysis of a single metaphorical sentence: This surgeon is a butcher. I will propose that conceptual metaphor theory as based on the idea of the main meaning focus gives us a good way of characterizing the emergence of the sentence's meaning. This characterization consists of a four-stage process. First, there exist two independent conceptual categories: BUTCHERY and SURGERY. Second, due to the similarity between the two, a metaphorical relationship is established between them. Third, the property of incompetence emerges in the concept of BUTCHERY in light of and against the background of the concept of SURGERY. Fourth, this property is projected into the blend, in which the property will now characterize the surgeon. I will point out that this approach is compatible with several other views, such as Ruiz de Mendoza's Combined Input Hypothesis and with aspects of relevance theory.},

Linguists have generally assumed that those contexts in which the new form is more common are those in which the form first appears and in which it advances most rapidly. However, evidence from several linguistic changes (most importantly the rise of the periphrastic auxiliary do in late Middle English) shows that the general assumption is false. Instead, at least for syntactic cases, change seems to proceed at the same rate in all contexts. Contexts change together because they are merely surface manifestations of a single underlying change in grammar. Differences in frequency of use of a new form across contexts reflect functional and stylistic factors, which are constant across time and independent of grammar.},

The child simultaneous bilingual literature mostly focuses on development in childhood, whereas heritage speakers are often tested at an endstate in adulthood. However, insights from child simultaneous bilingual acquisition must be considered in heritage language acquisition theorizing precisely because many heritage speakers demonstrate the adult outcomes of child simultaneous bilingual acquisition. Data from child simultaneous bilingual acquisition raises serious questions for the construct of incomplete acquisition, a term broadly used in heritage language acquisition studies to describe almost any difference heritage speakers display from baseline controls (usually monolinguals). We offer an epistemological discussion related to incomplete acquisition, highlighting the descriptive and theoretical inaccuracy of the term. We focus our discussion on two of several possible causal factors that contribute to variable competence outcomes in adult heritage speakers: input and formal instruction in the heritage language. We conclude by offering alternative terminology for heritage speaker outcomes.},

  abstract = {The decompositional, non-lexicalist, approach to word-structure and the theory of roots have proven highly rewarding. One grey area, however, comes from Romance since, rather than roots, the word structure primitive appears to be the stem: root + `stem-formative/theme vowel'. Regardless, there have been perspicacious decompositional accounts of Italian, however these are still marred by the large number of morphological/item-specific irregularities, motivating arbitrary noun classes. Additionally, there are roots that do not inflect: consonant-final and vowel-final forms when these are oxytonic or loanwords. Given these irregularities, previous analyses in Italian have included the use of lexical exceptions and class features. We challenge the use of class features in generating the attested patterns (and their exceptions). Instead, we propose a new categorisation of root-shapes, which, when combined with the exponents of nominal inflection, produce the correct surface pairings, as well as the non-alternating forms. In our analysis, there is no diacritic or special marking of lexical exceptions, all forms inflect regularly in accordance to their phonological shape. This requires the innovation of one new mechanism (Inhibition), but we back it up by showing that it leads to an unexpected beneficial prediction that solves a long-standing problem associated with Raddoppiamento Sintattico (RS).},

I offer an explicit syntax-semantics analysis of the two types, utilizing the idea that logophoric control structures are constructed as a second tier above predicative control structures.

Standard syntactic theories of OC explain the agreement but not the obligatory de se reading. A new synthesis is developed to solve this fundamental problem, in which the controller directly binds a variable in the edge of the complement. The associated semantics utilizes the idea that de se attitudes can be modelled as a special case of de re attitudes. The specific interaction of feature transmission and phase-based locality derives a striking universal asymmetry: Inflection on the embedded verb blocks OC in attitude complements but not in nonattitude complements. A semantic benefit is a straightforward account for ``unexpected'' binding between PRO and de re reflexives/pronouns.},

Earlier literature proposed that this is because aspectual for-phrases must modify predicates which are homogeneous-- meaning that the predicate spreads appropriately to subintervals -- and it proposed a notion of homogeneity which is appropriate for stative predicates. We argue in this first paper that neither the earlier literature, nor later proposals have managed to come up with an adequate account of the felicity of aspectual for-phrases with eventive predicates, and that, in particular, accomplishment and achievement predicates with bare arguments and iterative constructions remain challenges that these accounts cannot properly meet. We show that the problem lies in the notion of homogeneity for eventive predicates: the semantic tradition has provided us with static notions of homogeneity -- insensitive to the arrow of time -- but what is needed is a dynamic notion.},

(i. a) John [VP destroy the evidence] ``Pure VP''; (i. b) John -'s [NP destroying the evidence] Nominalized VP; (i. c) John -'s [NP destroying of the evidence] Nominalized V; (i. d) John -'s [NP destruction of the evidence] Deverbal N; (ii. a) NP [PP P1 NP] ``Pure PP''; (ii. b) NP -Ez [NP P2 NP] Nominalized PP; (ii. c) NP -Ez [NP P2 -Ez NP] Nominalized P; (ii. d) NP -Ez [NP P3 -Ez NP] ``Deprepositional'' N. The notion ``nominalization'' is thus shown to be relevant to both of the lexical categories - V and P - identified by Chomsky (1974) as [-N]. Our demonstration proceeds in three steps: 1) We establish a common syntactic function for English -'s/of and iPersian -EZ, viz., case-assignment, following Samiian 1994; Karimi and Brame 1986/2012; Larson and Samiian 2020; 2) We argue for a shared cross-categorial structure for VP-PP, developing proposals by Jackendoff 1973; van Riemsdijk 1990; Svenonius 2003. We show that if Jackendoff's (1977) ``scopal nominalization'' analysis of gerunds is extended to iPersian PPs, the parallelism in (i) and (ii) is accounted for; 3) We show that the full extension of nominalization to iPersian PPs suggests a more general view of nominalization than has been recognized previously, viz., a ``split-feature'' view of category specification. This has a variety of implications, which we briefly explore.},

I argue that movement or ellipsis can rescue a derivation with a strong feature, and I conclude that PF crash is relevant either directly, as in Chomsky 1993, or indirectly, as in the theory presented in Chomsky 1995a augmented by the multiple-chain theory of pied-piping (especially as interpreted by Ochi (1998)).},

In this paper, we provide a systematic presentation of the Poverty of the Stimulus Argument, clarifying its structure, content, and evidential base. We defend the argument against a variety of philosophical criticisms, new and old, and argue that the Poverty of the Stimulus Argument continues to deserve its guiding role in the study of language and the mind.},

This dissertation investigates this issue in the context of Warlpiri, the prototypical non-configurational language. I argue that positing a macroparameter, a single parameter that distinguishes configurational languages from non-configurational, requires variation on a magnitude not pennitted by Universal Grammar. After refuting in detail previous rnacroparametric approaches, I propose a microparametric analysis: non-configurational languages are fully configurational and analysed through finegrained parameters with independent motivation. I develop this approach for Warlpiri, partially on the basis of new data collected through work with Warlpiri consultants and analysis of Warlpiri texts.},

First, it supports the claim that ergative is an inherent case, through a study of the Warlpiri lexicon: no ergative-marked subjects are derived, in accordance with Marantz' Generalization. Second, it reanalyses syntactic ergativity in Dyirbal. It demonstrates that the language underlyingly has an ergative--nominative--accusative case system, with imperfect morphological realization of these cases. It further shows that syntactic ergativity in Dyirbal is not sensitive to the absolutive, but rather underlying nominative and accusative, regardless of morphological realization.},

We illustrate the complex patterns of attested splits, demonstrating that analyses positing a single dichotomy (e.g. between first and second person pronouns versus all other nominals) are insufficient.

While ergative assignment thus resists a simple, uniform analysis, the relevant factors are consistently based low in the clausal structure, centered around vP. The low factors identified include the theta-position and theta-role of the subject, the presence of a complement, the presence of a DP object, the case of the object, the presence of object agreement, and the Aspect selecting vP. Illustrative languages examined are Tsova-Tush (East Caucasian), Nez Perce (Sahaptin), Warlpiri (South-West Pama-Nyungan), Tshangla (Tibeto-Burman), and Hindi/Urdu (Indo-Aryan). Kurmanji Kurdish (Iranian) and Yukulta (Tangic) are also considered: here, the governing factors of ergative case assignment are prima facie high in the clause, based in TP/CP. These languages are revealed to instead fall under the low ergative pattern.},

The particular topics discussed include argument structure, word order, case, agreement, tense, aspect, clausal left periphery, or segmental phonology. The topical breadth and analytical depth of the contributions reflect the vitality of the field of formal Slavic linguistics and prove its relevance to the global linguistic endeavour.

Although everyone seems to be in agreement that indefi nites do not always introduce their own quantificational force, there is widespread disagreement as to whether they ever do. In this article, we present experimental evi dence from children learning English and Kannada demonstrating that children's indefinites show scopal restrictions parallel to the restrictions they show with other unambiguously quantificational expressions. Children, unlike adults, show a strong preference to assign quantificational expressions surface scope. This is true for both strong and weak quantifiers, which would be surprising on a theory of indefinites that treated these expressions as uniformly nonquantificational. Consequently, we argue that in adult grammars indefinites must have a quantificational representation at least some of the time.},

  abstract = {This article deals with the question of why negation under yiqian `before' in Mandarin Chinese does not alter the truth conditions of the sentence. I propose that the complement clause of yiqian must denote a situation that exhibits a potential change of state from the prior nonexistent state to the resultant post-state. The semantic interpretation of yiqian is sensitive to this change of state and may select either the initial or final point of the complement eventuality as a reference time, depending upon whether the complement clause denotes the priorstate or the post-state. The addition of mei under yiqian does not change the meaning of the sentence because before the latest time of the prior-state is truth-conditionally indistinguishable from before the earliest time of the post-state. In addition to Mandarin Chinese, this article discusses cross-linguistic variation of expletive negation in some typologically different languages, showing that the wide or narrow distribution of expletive negation may be due to the [{\textpm}interpretable] feature that a negation marker carries in a given language.},

It also identifies open questions and opportunities, showing how the future course of experimental iconicity research can benefit from an integrated interdisciplinary perspective. Combining insights from psychology and neuroscience with evidence from natural languages provides us with opportunities for the experimental investigation of the role of sound-symbolism in language learning, language processing, and communication.

Computational efficiency is one example of such a principle that has been suggested. In this chapter, the historical roots of the third factor perspective is traced and discussed. The third factor perspective in linguistics is also compared to a similar perspective in comparative biology outlined by the late Stephen Jay Gould. After a review of a few examples of what plausible third factors may be, the chapter ends with a discussion of the complex task of determining whether a given linguistic condition may be a third factor.},

Of those participles whose argument structure differs from that of the corresponding finite forms (most often because they lack the ability to govern an accusative object), some may have originated as adjectives or may have become adjectivized. A particular group of present participles in the Rgveda which tend to remain intransitive even when formed to transitive roots ar˙e negated participles, i.e. participles compounded with the negative prefix {\'a}(n)-. is is explained by assuming that the combining of a participle with the negative prefix was originally a process of adjectival derivation. Support for this hypothesis comes from a consideration of the two forms of the negated present participle of the verb {\textsurd}as `be', namely {\'a}sant- and a{\textasciimacron}{\textasciiacute}sant-.},

  author = {Maclaran, Rose},

  address = {United States -- New York},
  urldate = {2022-12-16},
  abstract = {The English demonstratives this/these and that/those occur as noun-phrase determiners (these cats), pronouns (I like that) and degree determiners (this big). They also have a variety of uses--deictic (look at that), anaphoric (Fred says he won the Open. Do you believe that?) and 'emotional' (That McEnroe is amazing). Their meaning, I claim, cannot be described in purely truth-conditional semantic nor in Gricean pragmatic terms: rather than contributing directly to the content of what is said it determines the context in which they are to be interpreted. The syntactic facts suggest that the demonstratives must be lexically classified as both NP determiners and degree determiners, the demonstrative pronouns being derived from the NP determiners by general rule. Their semantic representation, however, is essentially identical across syntactic categories. A comparison with other referring expressions shows that the demonstratives are definite, that they refer felicitously to known but non-salient entities, and that the proximate (this/these) is the marked or 'stronger' demonstrative. These differences, I argue, cannot be accounted for in terms of entailment. By using the expression that cat, rather than a cat, the cat or this cat, the speaker may say something inappropriate or misleading but will not thereby say something false rather than something true. In using a demonstrative the speaker does not describe the referent but instructs the hearer how to identify it. Central to this account is an analysis of context. Contexts must not be viewed as predetermined, as many models of discourse processing suggest. Rather, they are constructed in the course of comprehension. Contexts and utterance meaning, I propose, are mutually determining. Thus a unified account of the role of demonstratives can be given: a speaker uses a demonstrative to indicate that the context of comprehension is not necessarily the expected one, that a new entity or new aspect of an entity is being brought into the context. This accounts not only for the central deictic and anaphoric uses but also for the seeingly exceptional presentational this (There's this new store downtown) and restrictively modified that (All those in favour say "aye").},

Human language communication is via sequences of words, but language understanding requires constructing rich hierarchical structures that are never observed explicitly. The mechanisms for this have been a prime mystery of human language acquisition, while engineering work has mainly proceeded by supervised learning on treebanks of sentences hand labeled for this latent structure. However, we demonstrate that modern deep contextual language models learn major aspects of this structure, without any explicit supervision. We develop methods for identifying linguistic hierarchical structure emergent in artificial neural networks and demonstrate that components in these models focus on syntactic grammatical relationships and anaphoric coreference. Indeed, we show that a linear transformation of learned embeddings in these models captures parse tree distances to a surprising degree, allowing approximate reconstruction of the sentence tree structures normally assumed by linguists. These results help explain why these models have brought such large improvements across many language-understanding tasks.},

The presence or absence of a context sentence, varied across the two experiments, allowed an estimate of between-sentence effects on local and global processes.

English copular sentences of the structure DP be DP are classified into several types. The most discussed distinction is the one between predicational sentences and specificational sentences.~The two sentences differ in several ways. First, while the post-copular DP (DP2) in a predicational sentence predicates a certain property of a discourse referent es-tablished by the pre-copular DP (DP1), in a specificational sentence DP2 provides a value for a variable introduced by DP1. Furthermore, it is proposed that different copular sentences are associated with different information-structural properties. In particular, specificational sentences are claimed to obligatorily focus the post-copular constituent (Higgins 1979; Declerck 1988; Mikkelsen 2005, etc.), while predicational sentences carry no such requirements.},

These constructions have long been observed to give rise to inferences of proper partitivity: upon hearing a sentence like Sue talked to three of John's lawyers, we spontaneously understand that John has more than three lawyers, that is we interpret the partitive three of John's lawyers as denoting a proper subset of the denotation of John's lawyers. Contra the common idea that proper partitivity follows from the plain meaning of partitives, I defend here the view that partitives semantically express partitivity tout court, that is they encode the reflexive `part-of' relation, and that proper partitivity comes about as a result of a presuppositional implicature on the basis of the competition between those indefinite expressions and their non-partitive definite alternatives, e.g., John's three lawyers.},

  abstract = {This paper examines a phenomenon of Niuean (Oceanic) often called Noun Incorporation (NI). It is shown that, since the nominal element in these constructions is a phrase (NP) rather than a head \$(\{{\textbackslash}rm N\}{\textasciicircum}\{0\})\$. this phenomenon does not in fact consitute NI in the normal sense of the term. Instead, it is termed Pseudo Noun Incorporation, or PNI. An analysis is presented in which an object NP (rather than DP) is generated adjacent to a verb. Since NP cannot check absolutive case, it fails to move out of VP, hence it undergoes predicate fronting along with the verb to derive the 'incorporated' order V-O-PARTICLES-S-X: the normal order is V-PARTICLES-S-O-X. The properties of three subtypes of PNI are examined in some detail: general PNI, existential PNI, and instrumental PNI, and the analysis is developed to account for their properties. General PNI involves the generation of an NP object, in which the referential position remains open, resulting in a habitual reading for the sentence. Instrumental PNI is similar, except it does not have the same aspectual consequences. In existential PNI, on the other hand, an existential verb (fai 'have/be', muhu 'have plenty/be plentiful') binds the position in NP, thus allowing the NP to be referential and to be modified by a relative clause. Existential PNI thus results from a hybrid V/DET category (such as fai) which simultaneously binds the open position in NP and acts as the head predicate of the sentence. We see that the properties of Niuean PNI do not fit into the various typologies of NI available in the literature, hence a novel analysis is required, such as the one proposed in this paper.},

  abstract = {The standard analysis of quantification says that determiner quantifiers (such as every) take an NP predicate and create a generalized quantifier. The goal of this paper is to subject these beliefs to crosslinguistic scrutiny. I begin by showing that in St'{\'a}t'imcets (Lillooet Salish), quantifiers always require sisters of argumental type, and the creation of a generalized quantifier from an NP predicate always proceeds in two steps rather than one. I then explicitly adopt the strong null hypothesis that the denotations of quantifiers should be crosslinguistically uniform. Since the Salish data cannot be captured by the usual analysis of English, I pursue the idea that English is reducible to the Salish pattern. Reanalysis of many English constructions is required. I argue that the reanalysis has advantages over the standard analysis for partitives, as well as for non-partitive all- and most-phrases, which I analyze as containing bare plurals of argumental type. Even where the new analysis faces some challenges (for example, with every), the attempt still leads to fruitful results. It forces us to view familiar constructions in a new light, and to redefine, I believe correctly, which quantificational constructions are `basic' and which stand in need of further explanation.},

  doi = {10.1075/la.205.02mci},
  abstract = {Is it oxymoronic to speak of 'adjectival passives' in English? A construction like They seem very underrated by everyone resembles a canonical passive in some respects, for instance in the optional expression of an external argument in a by-phrase. However, such structures differ from canonical passives in various ways. They show adjectival properties like very-modification. Canonical passives often require particular auxiliaries (be in English), but adjectival participles have no such requirement (underrated people). Adjectival participles differ from normal passives in the interpretation (and existence) of implicit arguments in that by-phrases are illicit with some adjectival participles (the car seemed very damaged (*by John)) and in that a structure like very overdressed people allows a coreferent (i.e. reflexive) interpretation, unlike a verbal passive like they are being dressed. Such facts are often taken to show that verbal but not adjectival participles have implicit external arguments. Finally, unaccusative-based participles like wilted flowers are in no useful sense passive. Such facts have inspired analyses which do not recognize a notion of adjectival passive. This study will show that this is incorrect, suggesting that theories of non-canonical passivisation can benefit from an understanding of the grammar of adjectival participles. We proceed as follows. Section 1 discusses tests for adjectival participles and distinguishes three semantic classes of them, including a previously unnoted class which expresses an in-progress situation. Section 2 argues that Themes in adjectival participles are initially merged as external arguments, unlike Themes in standard passives. Section 3 challenges the standard claim that adjectival passives lack implicit Agents. I show that not all adjectival participles exhibit the coreferent interpretation seen in overdressed people, which I interpret as showing that they have implicit Agents. Constraints on by-phrases and purpose clauses are shown not to undermine this conclusion. Section 4 is a detailed discussion of adjectival participles based on unaccusatives. Constraints on such participles are argued to show that there must be passive-like rules which only tolerate transitive verbs as input. Section 5 proposes a syntactic and semantic analysis for the various types of adjectival participles. Some caveats: This study is a progress report, which I present, despite several unanswered questions and provisional analytic choices, because it unearths several previously undiscussed empirical phenomena and theoretical problems. If at some points I seem overzealous in arguing against elegant, unified, stipulation-free accounts, this is not due to fealty to some antiscientific anything-goes framework, but to doubts that the range of (familiar and new) data treated here allow elegant analyses. I hope nonetheless that that this essay will inspire attempts at more principled accounts with the same empirical coverage. 1 Distinguishing features of adjectival participles This section distinguishes adjectival participles from other participles and discusses their basic semantic properties, presenting both well-known and new observations. Standard tests for the adjectival status of participles are given in (1): (1) a. Adjectival degree modifiers: It is very \{neglected/damaged/overrated\}. b. Adjectival un-prefixation 1 : unopened presents; unattended-to matters c. Selection by AP-selecting verbs: It \{seemed/remained/became\} very damaged. d. Coordination with other A(P)s: They are \{dressed and ready/dead and buried\}. e. Incompatibility with double objects: *It remained given scant attention. DP-internal use of participles is not included in (1) since some DP-internal participles behave more like verbal participles than adjectival participles (cf. Sleeman 2011, Meltzer 2011, note 1 Cases like unwrapped presents could involve either verbal un-('presents which got unwrapped') or adjectival un-('presents which have not been wrapped'). The (here irrelevant) verbal reading asserts an event which caused the Theme not to be in a wrapped state, while the adjectival reading entails that no event occurred.},

  title = {Reflexive {{Clitics}} in the {{Slavic}} and {{Romance Languages}}.},
  author = {Medov{\'a}, Lucie},
  year = {2009},
  abstract = {In this work, I offer a unified analysis of all the constructions that involve a reflexive clitic SE in Slavic and Romance languages. Next to canonical constructions, in which the reflexive clitic semantically identifies the two arguments of a transitive verb, cf. John SE wash means John washes himself, there are constructions in which it is not possible to identify the arguments in this way, cf. anticausatives as The glass SE broke does not entail that the glass broke itself, it just broke. Inherently reflexive verbs do not exist without the reflexive clitic, certain prefixes cause the morpheme SE to appear in Slavic languages ROZ-rain *(SE) with a certain Aktionsart shift. Finally, there are impersonals and middles, in which the reflexive clitic SE seems to play the role of an unspecified human subject Cars SE sell means Cars are sold (by people)/People sell cars. The thesis is built in two steps. First, I consider possible derivations of the constructions with the reflexive clitic SE in Slavic and Romance and following Kayne (1986) and Alboiu et al. (2004) I propose that all the constructions are derived by movement: the argument that winds up as NOM starts out within the VP shell and moves to the NOM position. SE, on this view, is a morpheme that `blocks' the argument from becoming a direct object. This derivation is superior to the argument structure derivations (as they face the problem of ECM constructions, cf. Marantz (1984)) and derivations that connect the morpheme SE to the internal argument position (they predict the SE constructions to be transitive, contrary to the facts). Second, I claim that the reflexive clitic SE is an antipassive morpheme of the sort known from the ergative languages. This connection is clearly supported by the range of constructions that are created by the reflexive clitic SE in Slavic and Romance languages on one hand and antipassive morphemes in ergative languages on the other. In both language types, the particular morpheme (very often) creates also anticausatives, constructions with Aktionsart shift. I derive both antipassives and constructions with the reflexive clitic SE in a parallel fashion within the Peeling Theory of Case (Starke (2005), Starke (2006)).},

  abstract = {This paper introduces a uniform analysis of verbalizers in Sorani Kurdish. There are two morphemes, -an and -ja, which have been argued to index lexical semantic argument structure distinctions such as (non)-agentivity (Osmani, 2014) and causation (Badakhshan and Ghadimi, 2013), in line with the behavior of cognate morphemes in related languages e.g., Persian (Nabors, 2019). However, I will show that what these morphemes really index is transitivity: -an is used exclusively with transitive constructions, and -ja with intransitive ones, regardless of agentivity and causativity. Since transitivity and causativity are so closely correlated, it is tempting to conflate them, but with careful attention to argument structure diagnostics, they can be disentangled. I claim that the morpheme -an is a transitive verbalizer i.e., the syntactic structure it introduces is transitive. The morpheme -ja is an intransitive verbalizer i.e., it occurs with single argument predicates, namely unaccusatives, anticausatives, unergatives, and passives. I consider -an to have an accusative feature that case-marks the direct object while -ja lacks such a feature, a distinction that makes them v*P and vP respectively in the sense of Chomsky (2000). Moreover, each of these verbalizers has a null morpheme counterpart with the same features. I argue for this analysis based on causative constructions, and two different unergative constructions. Additionally, I provide some evidence from different varieties of Sorani to show that there are null verbalizers with the same characteristics in this language. Finally, as the morpheme -ja functions to license different constructions, I argue that there should be a voice head to determine the voice of the sentence as either active or non-active to distinguish different constructions e.g., unergatives, anticausatives, and passives.},

  abstract = {This article focuses on Hebrew adjectival passives, showing that, as was claimed for other languages, the class of adjectival passives in Hebrew is not homogenous, but rather consists of two sub-classes. Former attempts to capture the non-homogenous nature of the class of adjectival passives in different languages relied mainly on the existence versus absence of an event in their interpretation. In contrast, I argue that the criterion distinguishing the two sub-classes of adjectival passives in Hebrew is the presence versus absence of an implicit Agent or Cause argument. Thus, the split parallels a very well-known split in the verbal system---that between passive and unaccusative verbs. Once this parallelism between the adjectival and the verbal systems is recognized, it is possible to claim that the same valencechanging processes (namely, saturation and decausativization) are operative in both systems. This assumption can predict the syntactic and semantic behavior of the two sub-classes of adjectives, as well as their composition, without resorting to operations unique to adjectival passive formation.},

In these constructions the predication is ascribed in various modes to the experiencer argument. We focus on these constructions in the South Slavic languages in which they have a wide distribution, Macedonian, Bulgarian and Bosnian/Croatian/Serbian (BCS). The following basic types are identified: Emotional processes and states, Accidental, Perception/Cognition and Stative Reflexive-Dative Construction (SRDC). The specific clusters of features in each one are due to the inheritance properties from a reflexive construction, indicating a valence reduction, in combination with the features of affectedness and lack of control, characteristic of a dative argument. This results in varied but multiply linked patterns that create a complex network of constructions. The study aims at defining the relations between these constructions and in particular at determining the place of SRDC in this network.},

Like many evolutionary innovations, language arose from the adventitious combination of two preexisting, simpler systems that had been evolved for other functional tasks.The first system, Type E(xpression), is found in birdsong, where the same song marks territory, mating availability, and similar ``expressive'' functions. The second system, Type L(exical), has been suggestively found in non-human primate calls and in honeybee waggle dances, where it demarcates predicates with one or more ``arguments,'' such as combinations of calls in monkeys or compass headings set to sun position in honeybees. We show that human language syntax is composed of two layers that parallel these two independently evolved systems: an ``E'' layer resembling the Type E system of birdsong and an ``L'' layer providing words. The existence of the ``E'' and ``L'' layers can be confirmed using standard linguistic methodology. Each layer, E and L, when considered separately, is characterizable as a finite state system, as observed in several non-human species. When the two systems are put together they interact, yielding the unbounded, non-finite state, hierarchical structure that serves as the hallmark of full-fledged human language syntax. In this way, we account for the appearance of a novel function, language, within a conventional Darwinian framework, along with its apparently unique emergence in a single species.},

  abstract = {There are generally two views of how language emerged in evolution: emergent and gradual. The emergent view holds that language appeared relatively rapidly within the last 100,000 years, possibly due to some minor mutation. The gradualist view postulates stages of "protolanguage" that began as a simple system that progressively developed into ever-complex systems until language as we know it emerged. The original protolanguage may have been singing, as Darwin conjectured, or lexical in nature as proposed by a number of linguists. Human language is enormously rich and complex, which makes it difficult to imagine that all the components of it emerged somehow out of the blue in recent evolutionary time, yet there is no evidence for such a system earlier in evolution. The Integration Hypothesis holds that language is an integration of two independently occurring systems in nature that underlie communication. One system, exemplified by the alarm calls of primates, is the Lexical system, which is composed of isolated units of utterance that typically have a specific referent, such as "leopard," "snake," and "eagle" we see in the calls of Vervet monkeys. The Expression system, associated with birdsong, creates patterns without use of lexical items. Each system has developed over a long span of time, millions, and possibly hundreds of millions of years. At some point in recent evolutionary time, the two systems, L and E, integrated uniquely in humans to give rise to language, which gives the appearance of rapid emergence. I will speculate on how the integration may have been triggered.},

  abstract = {A common view is that natural language treats numbers as abstract objects, with expressions like the number of planets, eight, as well as the number eight acting as referential terms referring to numbers. In this paper I will argue that this view about reference to numbers in natural language is fundamentally mistaken. A more thorough look at natural language reveals a very different view of the ontological status of natural numbers. On this view, numbers are not primarily treated abstract objects, but rather `aspects' of pluralities of ordinary objects, namely number tropes, a view that in fact appears to have been the Aristotelian view of numbers. Natural language moreover provides support for another view of the ontological status of numbers, on which natural numbers do not act as entities, but rather have the status of plural properties, the meaning of numerals when acting like adjectives. This view matches contemporary approaches in the philosophy of mathematics of what Dummett called the Adjectival Strategy, the view on which number terms in arithmetical sentences are not terms referring to numbers, but rather make contributions to generalizations about ordinary (and possible) objects. It is only with complex expressions somewhat at the periphery of language such as the number eight that reference to pure numbers is permitted.},

These sound-symbolic relationships have been suggested to result in easier language acquisition, but previous studies have explicitly tested effects of sound symbolism on learning category distinctions but not on word learning. In 2 word learning experiments, we varied the extent to which phonological properties related to a rounded--angular shape distinction and we distinguished learning of categories from learning of individual words. We found that sound symbolism resulted in an advantage for learning categories of sound-shape mappings but did not assist in learning individual word meanings. These results are consistent with the limited presence of sound symbolism in natural language. The results also provide a reinterpretation of the role of sound symbolism in language learning and language origins and a greater specification of the conditions under which sound symbolism proves advantageous for learning.},

  abstract = {Word reordering is the most common way in Hindi for focalizing and thematizing a constituent, without morphological restructuration. A theme is thus fronted and a focus is preverbal. However, the language also displays other devices, namely particles, for this purpose, particularly but not only, for constituents already respectively fronted and preverbal in the unmarked order (SOV). The paper bears on the most frequent of such particles, the thematic enclitic particle to. Previous analyses have pointed to the extreme diversity of its meanings -- up to four ``homonyms'': intensive, contrastive, assertive, request particle. The present study explains this diversity in terms of a common operation which involves intersubjectivity. As a thematic particle, to requalifies the constituent as contrasting either with other elements present in the dialogue or with a view point on the constituent which has been previously expressed or attributed the other. Being highly sensitive to the exchange of distinct viewpoints, the particle may also cliticize to non-initial constituents, in which case it marks the whole statement as dismissing of opposing a previous proposal. The behaviour of the particle to may ultimately be traced to the other and older functions of the word used as a correlative pronoun and as a conjunction, which also presuppose an initial content as the starting point for a distinct predication or discourse sequence.},

The most recent development posits that movement is forced by morphological requirements (Chomsky 1995). In this paper I will suggest a different approach to movement, suggesting that it is essentially related to the geometry of phrase structure. A weak version of Kayne's 1994 theory of the antisymmetry of syntax, namely `dynamic antisymmetry' will be introduced. In the strong version, UG only allowed for antisymmetrical configurations, in terms of c-command. Within dynamic antisymmetry, however, symmetrical configurations can be generated, provided that movement makes them antisymmetric before spell-out. In other words, I will suggest that movement is a symmetry-breaking phenomenon, i.e. it is triggered by purely geometrical factors as opposed to morphological ones. Data will range from small clause constructions (both in copular sentences and believe-type verbs) to wh-movement in interrogatives. Italian and English will be the major sources of examples.},

  abstract = {This dissertation is a comparative study of the class of verbs commonly termed ``reflexive'' in Russian and Bosnian/Croatian/Serbian (BCS). These verbs occur with the affix -sja in Russian and with the clitic se in BCS. Despite the fact that they are commonly called reflexive, they do not necessarily refer to reflexive events in which the same entity is both agent and patient. The analysis has an emphasis on semantics and uses Cognitive Grammar as a framework to determine the semantic prototypes for this group of verbs in each language. It uses as a starting point Suzanne Kemmer's (1993) monograph on middle voice, which shows that Russian is a middle-marking language in which the light form -sja denotes middle voice and the heavy form sebja denotes true reflexivity. The study hypothesizes that Kemmer's analysis is accurate for Russian, but not for some other Slavic languages, namely BCS. Quantitative and qualitative analysis shows that in Russian the semantic prototype for verbs with -sja is MIDDLE, while in BCS the prototype for verbs with se is REFLEXIVE. The study defines semantic types for this group of verbs including REFLEXIVE, POSSESSIVE REFLEXIVE, RECIPROCAL, IMPERSONAL, PASSIVE, MIDDLE and BENEFACTIVE and sets up diagnostic tests for determining REFLEXIVE, POSSESSIVE REFLEXIVE, and RECIPROCAL events. Quantitative analysis is based on data collected from the Parasol parallel corpus from three parallel texts and shows that both languages have MIDDLE as the most frequent semantic type for SE-verbs for both languages, but also that that Russian sometimes uses a heavy form for REFLEXIVE, POSSESSIVE REFLEXIVE, or RECIPROCAL semantic types where BCS has a light form SE-verb. Qualitative data shows that BCS SE-verbs occur in various situations unique to BCS and not in Russian, including across-the-board dependencies, past passive participles formed from SE-verbs, and se modified by adjectives as a noun or pronoun would be modified. The combined quantitative and qualitative analysis shows that BCS SE-verbs maintain the syntactic structure of REFLEXIVE verbs, pointing to the conclusion that the prototype for BCS SE-verbs is REFLEXIVE, while the prototype for these verbs in Russian is MIDDLE.},

  abstract = {This paper addresses a peculiar asymmetry that arises with so-called remnant move- ment in German, that is, movement of an XP from which some other movement has already applied. It appears that an XP from which scrambling has taken place can undergo topicalization or wh-movement (thereby creating a trace that is not bound at S-structure), but not scrambling or left dislocation. It is argued that this apparent movement type asymmetry cannot be accounted for by invoking the notion of reconstruction, as has sometimes been suggested. Rather, the pertinent constraint on remnant movement follows from a principle of Unambiguous Domination which states that a trace with a (not necessarily c-commanding) antecedent in a position of type a must not be dominated by a category in a position of the same type a. Under this view, any movement type may in principle apply to a remnant XP - whether or not remnant movement is possible depends on whether or not the remnant XP ends up in a position that is formally different from the position occupied by the antecedent of the unbound trace. This prediction is shown to be corroborated by additional empirical evidence drawn mainly from German and English. Finally, the conceptual status of the Unambiguous Domination requirement is clarified.},

(b) These features are ordered on lexical items. (c) All phrases are phases. (d) Edge features that trigger intermediate movement steps can only be added before the phase head becomes inert. Given (a--d), it follows from the PIC that extraction from XP is blocked if the operation that has merged XP is the final operation taking place in a phase: a last-merged specifier is a barrier because no edge feature can be inserted that might extract some item out of it; this induces a PIC violation on the following cycle. The analysis can be extended to cover freezing effects. Furthermore, it predicts the existence of the melting effect, illustrated in German and Czech: local scrambling in front of what would otherwise qualify as a last-merged specifier renders the specifier transparent for extraction. The most important assumption made here is that the timing of edge feature insertion is crucial (before vs. after in (d)). Accordingly, the analysis can be viewed as an argument supporting a strictly derivational organization of grammar.},

We claim that these are used in the service of active inference in accord with the free-energy principle (FEP). While conceptual advances alongside modelling and simulation work have attempted to connect speech segmentation and linguistic communication with the FEP, we extend this program to the underlying computations responsible for generating syntactic objects. We argue that recently proposed principles of economy in language design---such as ``minimal search'' criteria from theoretical syntax---adhere to the FEP. This affords a greater degree of explanatory power to the FEP---with respect to higher language functions---and offers linguistics a grounding in first principles with respect to computability. While we mostly focus on building new principled conceptual relations between syntax and the FEP, we also show through a sample of preliminary examples how both tree-geometric depth and a Kolmogorov complexity estimate (recruiting a Lempel--Ziv compression algorithm) can be used to accurately predict legal operations on syntactic workspaces, directly in line with formulations of variational free energy minimization. This is used to motivate a general principle of language design that we term Turing--Chomsky Compression (TCC). We use TCC to align concerns of linguists with the normative account of self-organization furnished by the FEP, by marshalling evidence from theoretical linguistics and psycholinguistics to ground core principles of efficient syntactic computation within active inference.},

Central to the proposed theory is the distinction between what propositional content is at-issue and what content is not-at-issue. Evidentials contribute not-at-issue content, and can affect the level of commitment a sentence makes to the main proposition, contributed by sentential mood. In this volume, Sarah Murray builds on recent work in the formal semantics of evidentials and related phenomena, and proposes a semantics that does not appeal to separate dimensions of illocutionary meaning. Instead, she argues that all sentences make three contributions: at-issue content, not-at-issue content, and an illocutionary relation. At-issue content is presented and made available for subsequent anaphora, but is not directly added to the common ground; not-at-issue content directly updates the common ground; and the illocutionary relation uses the at-issue content to impose structure on the common ground, which, depending on the clause type, can trigger further updates. 0The analysis is supported by extensive empirical data from Cheyenne, drawn from the author's own fieldwork, as well as from English and a variety of other languages},

There is broad agreement in the field that there is some regularity in the way that lexical semantics and syntax are related, so that thematic roles are predictably associated with particular syntactic positions. This book examines the syntax and semantics of possession sentences, which are infamous for appearing to diverge dramatically from this broadly regular pattern. On the one hand, possession sentences have               too many meanings               : in a given language, the construction used to express archetypal possessive meanings (such as personal ownership) is also often used to express other apparently unrelated notions (body parts, kinship relations, and many others). On the other hand, possession sentences have               too many surface structures               : languages differ markedly in the argument structures used to convey the same possessive meanings, with some employing a transitive verb HAVE, and others using a variety of constructions based around an intransitive verb BE. Examining and synthesizing ideas from the literature and drawing on data from many languages (including some understudied Quechua dialects), this book presents a novel way to understand the apparent irregularity of possession sentences while preserving existing explanations for the general cross-linguistic regularities we observe in argument structure.},

However, the experimental data reported in this article do not support such an account: In an elicited-production task, 5- to 6-year-old children were found to be sensitive to their partner's perspective. Moreover, in an on-line comprehension task, they showed sensitivity to common-ground information from the initial stages of language processing.

  abstract = {This article investigates the use of metaphorical language in~The Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda~(henceforth CW). Vivekananda is one of the most important modern-day Hindu scholars because his interpretation of ancient Hindu scriptural lore has been very influential. Vivekananda's influence was part of the motivation for choosing his CW as the empirical domain for the current study. AntConc software was used to mine Vivekananda's CW for water-related terms, which seemed to have a predilection for metaphoricity. Which terms to search for specifically was determined after a manual reading of a sample from the CW. The data were then tagged using a convention inspired by the well-known Metaphor Identification Procedure -- Vrije University (MIPVU). Then, a representative sample of the data was chosen, and the metaphors were mapped and analysed thematically. Five of these are referred to in this article, but special emphasis is placed on the theme of the~Vedanta~philosophy as the basis for neo-Hinduism, which has become synonymous with contemporary Hinduism, with~Yoga~as the practical wing, and~Vedanta~as the ideological basis for the practice; this aspect is expounded upon in more detail. The study's main aim was therefore to investigate whether Hindu religious discourse uses metaphors to explain abstract religious concepts in a specific way, and indeed one of the main findings was the pervasiveness of water as a source domain. Hence, the key finding in this article is that neo-Hindu thought, as reconceptualised by Vivekananda, relies heavily on the~water~frame (as is convention in the field of Cognitive Semantics, conceptual domains are written in upper case, including hypothetical frames and conceptual metaphors), which is not as pervasive in other religio-philosophical traditions.},

In two studies, we asked English- and Spanish-speaking adults to interpret novel motion verbs presented in three types of sentence frames. Overall, English speakers expected novel verbs to encode the manner of motion, whereas Spanish speakers expected the verbs to encode the path of motion. The sentence frames also significantly affected how the speakers interpreted the novel verbs. We conclude that speakers of different languages represent their different generalizations about the composition of motion verbs both lexically and syntactically, and discuss how these generalizations might be important for issues of language acquisition and linguistic relativity.},

However, while this claim does work in the syntax, it creates problems in the morphology. For example, characterizing the well-known ``spurious se effect'' in Spanish simply cannot be done without reference to 3rd person. Inspired by alternatives to underspecification that have emerged in phonology (e.g., Calabrese, 1995), a revised featural system is proposed, whereby syntactic agreement may be relativized to certain values of a feature, in particular, the contrastive and marked values. The range of variation in PCC effects is shown to emerge as a consequence of the parametric options allowed on a Probing head, whereas the representation of person remains constant across modules of the grammar and across languages.},

The widely divergent surface difference results from the fact that person features are fully binary, whereas number features are syntactically privative. Additionally, arguments drawn from a variety of verbal cross-referencing morphemes implicating phi-interactions between subject and object support the claim that these elements are clitics, necessitating a principled morphosyntactic difference between clitics and other DPs undergoing object shift, and revisitation of the clitic-affix distinction.},

In Experiment 2, 3- to 4-year-old children used a speaker's perspective to guide their interpretation of instructions. In both experiments, egocentric interpretations of speaker requests were negatively correlated with children's inhibitory control skills. Results of these studies demonstrate that young children can differentiate between information that is accessible to the speaker versus privileged knowledge, and use this information to guide their communicative behaviors. Furthermore, the results suggest that children's inhibitory control skills allow them to inhibit their own perspective, enabling them to make use of their communicative partner's perspective.},

  year = {2000},
  abstract = {The status of covert movement in Universal Grammar has been a perennial source of trouble in the study of language. What kinds of structures does it derive? To whc;.t extent is it similar to overt movement? What is its place in the overall architecture of the grammar? In this thesis I present several case studies bearing on these questions, providing new evidence for the existence of covert phrase movement. These studies contribute to the growing body of evidence that grammatical conditions hold only at interface levels [Chomsky 1993]. Further, I attempt to show that, taken together, the investigations reported here lead to a model of grammar in which the interface representations are computed cyclically, by successive applications of the basic grammatical operations merge, move and spellout, on each phase ofderivation. The first studies demonstrate that covert movement licenses parasitic gaps and feeds Condition A, reversing longstanding assumptions. The apparent counterevidence that has obscured these properties of covert movement, I argue, results from a general constraint on movement (the Tucking-in condition [Richards 1991]) that prevents the formation ofthe required configurations in the classic experimental paradigms. In addition, the study on parasitic gaps provides evidence for the Y-model's sequencing ofovert before covert operations. However, an investigation of adjunct extraposition from NP (a report ofjoint work with D. Fox) yields evidence for the opposite conclusion: that a covert operation (QR) can be followed by an overt one (late adjunction to the raised NP). Finally, I show that these conflicting results are resolved by a theory of successive-cyclic computation of structure in which spellout applies repeatedly throughout a derivation. I argue that the correct characterization o f the cyclic model captures Y -model effects such as the failure ofcovert movement (typically) to license PGs, while allowing 'anti-Y-model effects' typified by extraposition. I propose a condition that limits countercyclic adjunction to the linear edge of already computed structures. This condition in turn predicts an intricate pattern of further generalizations about extraposition. The resulting theory thus unifies the overt and covert cycles in a manner consistent with the evidence for covert phrase movement.},

In this paper, we explore how 2--5-year-old children's comprehension of negation changes depending on the context in which a negative sentence occurs. We collected eye-tracking data while children watched a video in which they heard positive and negative sentences. Negative sentences, such as ``look at the boy with no apples,'' referred to a boy with nothing (Experiment 1) or a boy with an alternative object (Experiment 2). All children showed greater difficulty in resolving the referent when negative sentences referred to the boy with nothing, despite suggestions that nonexistence negations of this type are produced early in development. In addition, 3- and 4-year-old children showed an initial tendency to look away from the target and towards the named noun when the referent of the negative utterance was an alternative object. We argue that the processing of negation in young children is influenced by the cognitive demands of the pragmatic context in which the negative utterance occurs.},

Nevertheless, a considerable body of research that supports principles of sound symbolism has accumulated. This review discusses the most widely attested forms of sound symbolism and the research programs linked to sound symbolism that have influenced linguists and anthropologists most. Numerous reports of magnitude sound symbolism in the form of experimental studies and comparative surveys have been integrated into a biologically based theory of its motivation. Magnitude sound symbolism also catalyzed a number of experimental studies by psychologists and linguists in search of a universal sound-symbolic substrate underlying all languages. Although the search for a sound-symbolic substrate has been abandoned, the success rates of these studies have never been satisfactorily explained. Sound-symbolic processes have had a definitive impact on morphological analyses of phonesthemes and on historical linguists' understandings of diachronic processes. A typologically widespread form of sound symbolism occurs as a kind of lexical class known as the ideophone, which is conspicuously underdeveloped in standard average European languages, and highly perplexing for linguists and anthropologists. Although it has always been a respectable domain of inquiry in ethnopoetics and interpretive ethnography, the case for sound symbolism has of late been argued with renewed vigor on the part of psychological anthropologists and philosophers who see a paradigm shift under way.},

Native English-speaking monolinguals learned meanings for Japanese words in a vocabulary-learning task. Spoken Japanese words were paired with English meanings that: (1) matched the actual meaning of the Japanese word (e.g., ``hayai'' paired with fast); (2) were antonyms for the actual meaning (e.g., ``hayai'' paired with slow); or (3) were randomly selected from the set of antonyms (e.g., ``hayai'' paired with blunt). The results showed that participants learned the actual English equivalents and antonyms for Japanese words more accurately and responded faster than when learning randomly paired meanings. These findings suggest that natural languages contain non-arbitrary links between sound structure and meaning and further, that learners are sensitive to these non-arbitrary relationships within spoken language.},

In this paper, we discuss three different types of Voice syncretism, under which the same morpheme participates in different configurations. We provide an approach under which the same Voice head can convey different interpretations depending on the environment it appears in, thus building on the notion of allosemy. We show that, in all cases under investigation, allosemy is closely associated with the existence of idiosyncratic patterns. By contrast, we notice that allosemy and idiosyncrasy are not present in analytic passive and causative constructions across different languages. We argue that the distinguishing feature between the two types of constructions is whether the passive and the causative interpretation comes from the Voice head, thus forming a single domain with the vP or whether passive and causative semantics are realized by distinct heads above the Voice layer, thus forming two distinct domains.},

Here, we submit a scenario describing the process in which courtship songs gained in complexity during the course of domestication of Bengalese finches. By comparing domesticated Bengalese finches with their wild strain, white-rumped munias, we found that female preferences for complex songs were coupled with domesticated relaxed environments to give rise to song complexity. Furthermore, we found that the outcomes of domestication in Bengalese finches include decreased psychological and physiological stress reactions, decreased aggressiveness, and changed plumage colors. These characteristics are consistent with Bdomestication syndrome,{\textasciicircum} originally proposed for mammals but now possibly applicable to birds. Our finding that domestication was a cause of signal complexity might be helpful in considering the process of signal evolution in human language.},

  abstract = {Many complex spike cells in the hippocampus of the freely moving rat have as their primary correlate the animal's location in an environment (place cells). In contrast, the hippocampal electroencephalograph theta pattern of rhythmical waves (7- 12 Hz) is better correlated with a class of movements that change the rat's location in an environment. During movement through the place field, the complex spike cells often fire in a bursting pattern with an interburst frequency in the same range as the concurrent electroencephalograph theta. The present study examined the phase of the theta wave at which the place cells fired. It was found that firing consistently began at a particular phase as the rat entered the field but then shifted in a systematic way during traversal of the field, moving progressively forward on each theta cycle. This precession of the phase ranged from 100" to 3.55" in different cells. The effect appeared to be due to the fact that individual cells had a higher interburst rate than the theta frequency. The phase was highly correlated with spatial location and less well correlated with temporal aspects of behavior, such as the time after place field entry. These results have implications for several aspects of hippocampal function. First, by using the phase relationship as well as the firing rate, place cells can improve the accuracy of place coding. Second, the characteristics of the phase shift constrain the models that define the construction of place fields. Third, the results restrict the temporal and spatial circumstances under which synapses in the hippocampus could be modified.},

We also argue that semantic concepts such as specificity, definiteness, animacy, or topicality, tightly connected to the presence or absence of A, must be parasitic on the syntactic configurations where DOM is licensed. We also present some consequences of our analysis for the general theory of agreement. We argue that the same structural relation is involved in all cases of DOM, as well as in Dative Clitic Constructions, where the presence of the particle A preceding clitic-doubled datives is syntactically unified with DOM phenomena. The accusative/dative distinction traditionally attributed to the Spanish pronominal system does not correspond, in synchronic terms, to different case relations, but distinguishes between agreeing and nonagreeing arguments. Similarly, the distribution of DOM corresponds to a Casechecked/Caseless difference. We extend the analysis to account for well-known restrictions on the co-appearance of two DOM arguments, which are analyzed as the consequence of a competition between two arguments for a single target. To finish, the analysis of some additional DOM phenomena in Spanish also leads us to conclude that Case and agreement must be independently maintained as two separated checking relations.},

  abstract = {In traditional grammar, the inflection of a word's different forms based on the possible morphosyntactic property combinations of the language can be ordered into a tables. Words of the same part of speech often can be grouped together when they inflect in similar fashions. These similar groups are represented by a single word that expresses the morphosyntactic property set possible for that part of speech. These groups are called declensions. These declensions are not always complete sometimes there is a particular morphosyntactic property set that does not have a corresponding form (word). This is known as defectiveness. One approach that deals with this issue and more that arise with regard to gaps and redundancies in the morphology of a language is Paradigm Function Morphology (PFM). This type of morphology developed by Gregory Stump is based off his inferential-realizational ``paradigm-linkage theory''. Stump uses his theory to account for many of the issues that can arise in an inflectional system such as morphomic properties, overabundance, overdifferentiation, syncretism, deponency, metaconjugation, and heteroclisis. This thesis will evaluate the seven nominal declensions of Modern Eastern Armenian using Paradigm Function Morphology.},

  abstract = {Perceptual experiences in one modality are often dependent on activity from other sensory modalities. These cross-modal correspondences are also evident in language. Adults and toddlers spontaneously and consistently map particular words (e.g., `kiki') to particular shapes (e.g., angular shapes). However, the origins of these systematic mappings are unknown. Because adults and toddlers have had significant experience with the language mappings that exist in their environment, it is unclear whether the pairings are the result of language exposure or the product of an initial proclivity. We examined whether 4-month-old infants make the same sound--shape mappings as adults and toddlers. Four month-olds consistently distinguished between congruent and incongruent sound--shape mappings in a looking time task (Experiment 1). Furthermore, mapping was based on the combination of consonants and vowels in the words given that neither consonants (Experiment 2) nor vowels (Experiment 3) alone sufficed for mapping. Finally, we confirmed that adults also made systematic sound--shape mappings (Experiment 4); however, for adults, vowels or consonants alone sufficed. These results suggest that some sound--shape mappings precede language learning, and may in fact aid in language learning by establishing a basis for matching labels to referents and narrowing the hypothesis space for young infants. {\'O} 2012 Elsevier Inc.

A phase-based Person-Constraint, triggered by an interpretable person feature on the Applicative head, is responsible for the grammatical marking of the indirect object as a point-of-view center. Variation in the values of the interpretable person feature are shown to have counterparts in logophoric roles. The Person-Constraint has several clauses, which are subject to parametric variation, and which account for the range of cross-linguistic variation in PCC effects. The clauses of the P-Constraint are regulated by a theory of markedness, making predictions about how widely attested and robust the different types of PCC grammars are.},

To address these questions, we experimentally compared motion descriptions produced by children and adults in two typologically distinct languages, Greek and English. Our findings confirm a well-known asymmetry between the two languages, such that English speakers are overall more likely to include manner of motion information than Greek speakers. However, mention of manner of motion in Greek speakers' descriptions increases significantly when manner is not inferable; by contrast, inferability of manner has no measurable effect on motion descriptions in English, where manner is already preferentially encoded. These results show that speakers actively monitor aspects of event structure, which do not find their way into linguistic descriptions. We conclude that, in regard to the differential encoding of path and manner, which has sometimes been offered as a prime example of the effects of language encoding on nonlinguistic thought, surface linguistic encoding neither faithfully represents nor strongly constrains our mental representation of events.},

An equally important dimension is intervention: when do the trigger and target stop seeing each other? This paper offers two case studies on intervention from Modern Greek verbal morphology. In Greek, Agr is sensitive to the features of Voice, and T is sometimes sensitive to the identity of the root; but in both cases, allomorphy only takes place when all heads intervening between the target and trigger are null. When at least one intervening head is overt, the target retreats to a default realization. I argue that such patterns, whereby intervention leads to the emergence of a default, are readily understandable in theories where adjacency of heads is a necessary condition for allomorphy, and where only null nodes may be transparent.},

We argue that these facts can be readily understood if {$\varphi$}-features are crucially implicated in the syntactic derivation of binding.

We argue that it provides crucial evidence against movement-based approaches to clitic doubling, which would incorrectly rule out first conjunct clitic doubling as a violation of the Coordinate Structure Constraint. This argument against movement is complemented by evidence from binding, showing that doubled DPs consistently occupy their base positions. The Greek data instead favor an account based purely on feature transmission via Agree. We develop an Agree-based analysis of the Greek facts, and show that existing evidence for movement in Greek clitic doubling (Weak Crossover alleviation, suspension of intervention effects) can be insightfully reanalyzed. The alleviation of Weak Crossover effects receives a more straightforward account compared to movementbased approaches, in that it can be subsumed under the general mitigating effects of information structure (givenness, topicality); the intervention pattern follows once the activity of a DP is related to the involvement of its phi-features in Agree operations; and the distribution of clitic doubling is implemented by means of a licensing approach, assimilating clitic doubling to differential object marking. Finally, we address two morphological aspects of clitic doubling that are often taken to be challenging for an Agree-based account, namely, the syncretism between determiners and clitics, and tense invariance. We show that, upon closer inspection, the former is no less challenging for movement approaches, while the latter cannot be considered a reliable diagnostic to tease apart agreement and clitic doubling.},

An equally important dimension is intervention: when do the trigger and target stop seeing each other? Through the lens of a detailed analysis of Greek verbal morphology, I examine the conditions under which intervention forces the insertion of a default exponent. On the basis of two case studies on affixal allomorphy and one on stem allomorphy, I argue that patterns of intervention are easily accommodated under adjacency-based theories of the locality of allomorphy, and mysterious under less restrictive alternatives.},

  abstract = {This dissertation provides an investigation of the syntactic, morphological and interpretive properties of voice on the basis of a number of case studies from Modern Greek. The focus throughout is on diagnosing aspects of the syntax of argument introduction, and on reconciling these with the morphology and interpretation of argument relations. In so doing, I show that the core properties of the Greek voice system can be insightfully captured under an understanding of grammatical architecture where morphology is both syntactically informed and autonomous in the way it interprets and adjusts the output of the syntax.  The dissertation takes as its starting point a central fact concerning the realization of voice in Greek, namely, Voice syncretism, whereby a number of arguably distinct argument-structural configurations opposed to the active syncretize into the same set of morphological exponents. In Chapter 2, I show that the analysis of this phenomenon is illuminated by that of a second crucial fact of Greek verbal morphology, namely, Voice displacement: though we expect Voice distinctions to reside low in the syntactic structure, in Greek they appear indexed on word-peripheral affixes. A sharpened understanding of the two phenomena makes it possible to defend and make precise an analysis that links nonactive morphology to the absence of a thematic subject, and that affords nonactive, but not 'active', a privileged status at PF.  This perspective on the origins of Voice syncretism raises vexing questions for the syntax of verbal reflexives, one of the syncretizing categories par excellence. Verbal reflexives and reciprocals systematically bear nonactive morphology even though, unlike passives and their ilk, their surface subject is clearly linked to the agent role. In Chapter 3, I resolve the puzzle by showing that Greek evidences true unaccusative reflexives, whereby a structure employing a single syntactic argument originating low in the verbal phrase yields a reflexive interpretation. The resulting analysis sheds light on the nature of reflexive interpretations broadly construed, and on the differences between pronominal and verbal reflexivity more specifically. Finally, Chapter 4 takes up the issue of argument introduction in (stative) passives in Greek. After establishing that eventive passives bear the structural profile that ensures their systematic participation in the syncretism, I deploy eventive passives as a comparandum against which to probe the issue of inheritance of verbal properties in the stative passive. I uncover a range of novel generalizations that suggest the event and argument structure of the stative passive is distinguished from the eventive, and argue that the contrasts follow if Greek stative passives instantiate a 'small' mixed category, effectively an instance of complex head formation.},

  abstract = {This article introduces two new mathematical formulas designed to describe, compare, and contrast languages in terms of the overall markedness and complexity of their phonological rule components. The Transparency Index evaluates the four classical types of ordering relationships which obtain between individual pairs of rules, building on Kiparsky's (1968, 1971) classification of these as either feeding, bleeding, counterfeeding, or counterbleeding. Among these, feeding and bleeding orders are transparent in that they result in surfacetrue generalizations and are therefore natural and preferred, whereas counterbleeding and counterfeeding relationships lead to opaque (non-transparent) phonetic outcomes since the final surface representation appears to be a counterexample to one of the rules. For each language that we wish to analyze, the Transparency Index calculates the attested frequency of both types of transparent interactions grouped together (feeding and bleeding), and divides this sum by the total number of tokens of all four rule ordering types combined. The Density Index, on the other hand, computes the total number of crucial rule orderings (regardless of which kind) among each exhaustive, languagespecific inventory of processes. These two statistical proposals are applied to a sample of seven genetically and areally diverse languages to illustrate their usefulness and rank each language along a continuum of relative typological markedness and simplicity. This study constitutes the first rigorous attempt to quantify the occurrence of different types of phonological rule relationships --including their degree of interaction and inherent rate of opacity -- both within and across languages. It thus represents a step forward in extending an old line of inquiry into a topic which has recently spawned a renewed wave of interest, partly due to the problems it raises for standard Optimality Theory.},

This is because music and language share certain cognitive processing mechanisms and because music offers specific advantages for cross-species research. Music has relatively simple building blocks (tones without semantic properties), yet these building blocks are combined into rich hierarchical structures that engage complex cognitive processing. I illustrate this point with regard to the processing of musical harmonic structure. Because the processing of musical harmonic structure has been shown to interact with linguistic syntactic processing in humans, it is of interest to know if other species can acquire implicit knowledge of harmonic structure through extended exposure to music during development (vs. through explicit training). I suggest that domestic dogs would be a good species to study in addressing this question.},

In this paper, we review the different types of iconic mappings that characterize languages in both modalities, including the predominantly visually iconic mappings found in signed languages. Having shown that iconic mapping are present across languages, we then proceed to review evidence showing that language users (signers and speakers) exploit iconicity in language processing and language acquisition. While not discounting the presence and importance of arbitrariness in language, we put forward the idea that iconicity need also be recognized as a general property of language, which may serve the function of reducing the gap between linguistic form and conceptual representation to allow the language system to ``hook up'' to motor, perceptual, and affective experience.},

Adults evaluated `Most of the dots are yellow', as true or false, on many trials in which yellow dots and blue dots were displayed for 200 ms. Displays manipulated the ease of using a `one-to-one with remainder' strategy, and a strategy of using the Approximate Number System to compare of (approximations of) cardinalities.

After introducing the basic data and critically reviewing two previous analyses, I propose a new approach to adverbs of completion. The hallmark of the new approach is to provide as uniform a semantics as possible for adverbs of completion in both of their uses, taking seriously the intuition that their meanings make reference to events and degrees. The analyses are cast in an event semantics supplemented by a degree semantics familiar from treatments of gradable adjectives.},

  abstract = {This paper presents and analyzes a unique pattern of long-distance agreement (LDA) in the Nakh-Daghestanian language Tsez, spoken in the Caucasus. The phenomenon, in which a verb may agree with a constituent inside its clausal complement, poses a serious challenge to theories of agreement locality. In a number of formal syntactic theories, agreement between a head and an argument reflects some very local clause-mate configuration, often specifier-head. We demonstrate that this is inadequate for a satisfactory analysis of LDA and we propose an alternative that appeals to a less local configuration resembling head government. Crucial to our analysis of LDA is the generalization that LDA is triggered by a constituent which must be a topic. We argue that the agreement trigger moves covertly to an A topic position within its own clause where it is in a local agreement configuration with the verb. Independent evidence for covert movement and the existence of configurations which block LDA support the analysis. The primary conclusion is that syntactic agreement cannot be reduced to a specifier-head configuration in all cases. The theory must allow a less local configuration in which the target simply governs the agreement trigger.},

The results show no processing difference between the ergative subject gap and the absolutive object gap. The absolutive subject gap, however, is processed much faster. We propose a principled explanation for this result. On the one hand, Avar has a subject preference (cf. the Accessibility Hierarchy, Keenan and Comrie, 1977), which would make the processing of the ergative and the absolutive subject gap easier than the processing of the absolutive object gap. On the other hand, the ergative DP in a relative clause serves as a strong cue that allows the parser to project the remainder of the clause, including the absolutive object DP (cf. Marantz, 1991, 2000); such morphological cueing favors the absolutive object gap. Thus, two processing preferences, the one for subject relatives and the other for morphologically cued clauses, cancel each other out in terms of processing difficulty. As a result, reading time results for the ergative subject and absolutive object relative clauses are very similar. The overall processing results are significantly different from what is found in accusative languages, where subject preference and morphological cueing reinforce each other, leading to a strong transitive subject advantage.},

In furtherance of this trend, the current work synthesizes pertinent empirical observations and theoretical claims about vulnerable and robust areas of heritage language competence into early steps toward a model of heritage language grammar. We highlight two key triggers for deviation from the relevant baseline: the quantity and quality of the input from which the heritage grammar is acquired, and the economy of online resources when operating in a less dominant language. In response to these triggers, we identify three outcomes of deviation in the heritage grammar: an avoidance of ambiguity, a resistance to irregularity, and a shrinking of structure. While we are still a ways away from a level of understanding that allows us to predict those aspects of heritage grammar that will be robust and those that will deviate from the relevant baselines, our hope is that the current work will spur the continued development of a predictive model of heritage language competence.},

  abstract = {This book presents the essential background for understanding semantic theories of mood. 'Mood' as a category is widely used in the description of languages and the formal analysis of their grammatical properties. It typically refers to the features of a sentence--individual morphemes or grammatical patterns--that reflect how the sentence contributes to the modal meaning of a larger phrase, or that indicate the type of fundamental pragmatic function that it has in conversation. In this volume, Paul Portner discusses the most significant semantic theories relating to the two main subtypes of mood: verbal mood, including the categories of indicative and subjunctive subordinate clauses, and sentence mood, encompassing declaratives, interrogatives, and imperatives. He evaluates those theories, compares them, and draws connections between seemingly disparate approaches, and he formalizes some of the literature's most important ideas in new ways in order to draw out their most significant insights. Ultimately, this work shows that there are crucial connections between verbal mood and sentence mood which point the way towards a more general understanding of how mood works and its relation to other topics in linguistics; it also outlines the type of semantic and pragmatic theory which will make it possible to explain these relations. The book will be a valuable resource for researchers and students from advanced undergraduate level upwards in the fields of semantics and pragmatics, philosophy, computer science, and psychology},

  abstract = {Southern Ndebele is the language with the smallest number of speakers of all eleven official languages of South Africa. It is thus not surprising that there is no comprehensive description of the copulatives of this language. This article offers an exposition of the grammatical structure of the identificative copulatives of Southern Ndebele. The basic grammatical structure of the copulatives of this language is very similar to that of Zulu. However, the unfailing occurrence of a copulative verb stem ``-si'' in all negative stative copulatives is an outstanding characteristic of Southern Ndebele. The occurrence of this copulative verb stem in Southern Ndebele offers the strongest language external evidence (in support of language internal evidence) of the underlying negative stative copulative of Zulu as being ``-si'' as well. The identificative copulative particle that occurs as ``ngi'' with the pronouns of all persons and noun classes as complement in Southern Ndebele, also serves as language external evidence for the postulation of the identificative copulative particle of Zulu as ``ngi''. Zulu grammarians postulate this identificative copulative particle of Zulu as ``nga'', ``ngu'' or even ``ng''. It is argued in this article that the identificative copulative particle of Zulu is indeed ``ngi''.},

We observe that the use of context variables implies that tPPs can modify expressions in two ways, and we use this observation to predict the behaviour of tPPs whose complements are themselves modified by other tPPs.},

The workings of the proposed diagnostic are demonstrated using a family of constructions in ``substandard'' Basque (Etxepare 2006).

That is, there is no such thing as ``abstract'' {$\phi$}-agreement, null across the entire paradigm. Applying the same diagnostic to instances of clitic doubling, we see that these do involve syntactic agreement. This cannot be because clitic doubling is agreement; it behaves like movement (and unlike agreement) in a variety of respects. Nor can this be because clitic doubling, qua movement, is contingent on prior agreement---since the claim that all movement depends on prior agreement is demonstrably false. Clitic doubling requires prior agreement because it is an instance of non-local head movement,~and movement of X0 to Y0 always requires a prior syntactic relationship between Y0 and XP. In local head movement (the kind that is already permitted under the Head Movement Constraint), this requirement is trivially satisfied by (c-)selection. But in non-local cases, agreement~must fill this role.},

I provide a fragment of this proto-grammar, which includes flat verb-noun compounds used for naming and insult (e.g., rattle-snake, cry-baby, scatter-brain), and paratactic (loose) combinations of such flat structures (e.g., Come one, come all; You seek, you find). This flat, binary, paratactic platform is found in all languages, and can be shown to serve as foundation for any further structure building. However, given the degree and nature of variation across languages in elaborating syntax beyond this proto-stage, I propose that hierarchical syntax did not emerge once and uniformly in all its complexity, but rather multiple times, either within Africa, or after dispersion from Africa. If so, then, under the uniregional hypothesis, our common ancestor with Neandertals, H. heidelbergensis, could not have commanded hierarchical syntax, but ``only'' the proto-grammar. Linguistic reconstructions of this kind are necessary for formulating precise and testable hypotheses regarding language evolution. In addition to the hominin timeline, this reconstruction can also engage, and negotiate between, the fields of neuroscience and genetics, as I illustrate with one specific scenario involving FOXP2 gene.},

However, Dependent Case Theory cannot completely abandon case assignment via a syntactic head, as this mechanism accounts for lexical case (e.g. lexp ical dative). Furthermore, structural and lexical datives are morphologically identical and often behave similarly, and `just where the line should be drawn between the two is a theoretical matter' (Baker 2015: 13). We argue for a unified approach to lexical and structural dative case assignment under Dependent Case Theory, imre plemented in a derivational fashion, via the operation Agree. While structural dat is assigned as a high dependent case in the VP in the presence of a lower (later acc) DP, lexical dat is assigned in the same configuration, in the VP, in the presence of another silent or overt co-argument DP.},

  abstract = {Verbal arguments can be divided into two different types: those that are true arguments of the verb and those that are "additional" in the sense that there is evidence that they do not belong to the basic argument structure of the verb. Theories of argument structure are largely theories about how these additional arguments are introduced, but at present few such theories propose explicit mechanisms for deriving crosslinguistic variation in argument expression. This thesis develops a tightly constrained universal system of functional units and argues that crosslinguistic variation arises either from differences in the inventory of units that a language selects for or from the way a language groups the universal units into syntactic heads. The core system consists of three different types of causative heads, two different types of applicative heads and the external argument introducing head Voice (Kratzer 1994). The thesis shows that the properties of applicative constructions are such that they can only be predicted by a theory in which the external argument is also "additional", i.e. not a true argument of the verb.},

  author = {Rasekhi, Vahideh},
  year = {2018},
  address = {United States -- New York},
  urldate = {2024-04-30},
  abstract = {In this dissertation, adopting Rizzi's (1997) Split-CP hypothesis, I provide a unified account for various elliptical structures in Persian on the basis of the interaction between information structure and ellipsis licensing feature bundles. I argue that ellipsis is constrained by information structure, in particular topic and focus. Only the elements that carry contrastive topic or contrastive focus features can survive ellipsis while the other elements are elided under identity with their corresponding elements in the antecedent clause. I discuss Merchant's (2001) theory of ellipsis, in which the elements that survive ellipsis have a focus feature, and show that his approach cannot account for the Persian data. I argue that it is contrast that saves elements from being elided. Therefore, I propose the Identity Condition on the Remnant, stated in (1). (1) Identity Condition on the Remnant (i) There must be a contrastive relationship between the remnant and its correlate, and (ii) They must have the same information structure, i.e. both of them must be topicalized or focalized elements. Based on the identity condition in (1), not only there must be a contrastive relationship between the remnant and its correlate in the antecedent clause, but also they must have identical information structure, i.e. they both must be topicalized or focalized elements. On the other hand, the elements that are already given are elided under identity with their antecedent. To account for elliptical constructions in Persian, I propose the Contrast Condition on Ellipsis, stated in (2). (2) Contrast Condition on Ellipsis (i) Ellipsis Condition: Ellipsis can occur iff there is an element {$\alpha$} in XPE that contrasts with an element {$\alpha$}' in XPA, in which a) {$\alpha$} and {$\alpha$}' have the same syntactic category, and b) XP(E) and XP(A) have the same syntactic structure. (ii) Identity Condition on the Remnant: An element {$\alpha$} in XP(E) can survive ellipsis iff there is an element {$\alpha$}' in an XP(A), in which {$\alpha$} and {$\alpha$}' are in a contrastive relationship and have identical information structure. (iii) Identity Condition on the Elided Materials: An element {$\beta$} in XP(E) can be elided iff there is an element {$\beta$}' in an XP(A), in which {$\beta$} and {$\beta$}' are identical. (The identity relation is sensitive to both semantic and syntactic forms) Based on the first condition in (2), ellipsis is possible only in contexts in which an element in a sentence involving ellipsis contrasts with its corresponding element in the antecedent clause. The second condition, which is the Identity Condition on the Remnant, means that the element that survives ellipsis must be in a contrastive relationship with its correlate and they must have identical information structure. Based on the third condition, an element can be elided only if it is identical to its corresponding element in the antecedent clause. Regarding licensing ellipsis, I propose that ellipsis in Persian is licensed by the heads that have a focus feature, i.e. Foc(us) head, Pol(arity) head and Int(errogative) head. The proposed licensing heads are the result of the restrictions on the feature bundles that are possible in Persian. The [E] feature (Merchant 2001), which licenses the deletion of its complement at the PF level, can bundle with i) a strong uninterpretable contrastive focus [ConF] feature, [E, uConF*], ii) a strong uninterpretable [wh] feature, [E, uwh*], and iii) an uninterpretable [Pol] feature, [E, uPol]. The [uConF*] and [uwh*] features trigger the movement of the elements with interpretable [wh] and [ConF] features out of the phrase that is specified for deletion. On the other hand, the [ uPol] feature is satisfied by having a polarity marker in the Spec of PolP. The polarity marker can be affirmative or negative, depending on the polarity of the preceding clause. Based on the proposed theory, I study various elliptical structures in Persian. In chapters 2 and 3, I provide an in depth analysis of Verb-stranding and Stripping constructions with negation, respectively. In chapter 4, I provide an overview of Why-stripping, What-stripping, Chera-stripping, Gapping, Sluicing, Fragment Answers, and Noun Phrase Ellipsis.},

This renders suspect both `specificational analyses', on which the cleft clause both semantically and syntactically modifies it, and `expletive analyses', on which the cleft clause and clefted XP are both semantically and syntactically composed directly. I provide new evidence for Hedberg's type of analysis. The first set of evidence suggests that cleft it is non-expletive, thus arguing in favour of treating it and the cleft clause as a discontinuous definite description. The second set of evidence shows that, with respect to various tests, the cleft clause behaves as if the clefted XP, rather than it, is its antecedent.},

The workshop RLMG has been devoted to connecting the linguistic use of resource logics and categorial grammar to minimalist grammars and related generative grammars. Minimalist grammars are relatively recent, and although they stem from a long tradition of work in transformational grammar, they are largely informal apart from a few research papers. The study of resource logics, on the other hand, is formal and stems naturally from a long logical tradition. So although there appear to be promising connections between these traditions, there is at this point a rather thin intersection between them. The papers in this workshop are consequently rather diverse, some addressing general similarities between the two traditions, and others concentrating on a thorough study of a particular point. Nevertheless they succeed in convincing us of the continuing interest of studying and developing the relationship between the minimalist program and resource logics. This introduction reviews some of the basic issues and prior literature.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we propose that there is a speech act structure in the nominal spine, just as there is in the clausal spine whose function is to encode what we do when we utter a nominal: i.e., we name, describe, or track individuals. Thus, speech act structure establishes a link between the discourse referent and the speech act situation. The evidence we discuss comes from nominals that lack this speech act structure, namely impersonal pronouns. We argue that impersonal pronouns have in common that they lack nominal speech act structure but are not otherwise a natural class: they vary in syntactic structure. Thus, we propose a novel formal typology of impersonal pronouns.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we argue that certain Slavic reflexive clitics should be analyzed as indefinite defective pronouns in both syntax and semantics, and we go on to identify syntactic and semantic parametric variation among reflexive clitics in Slavic. Reflexive clitics that correspond to people represent nominative indefinite pronouns in Polish and Slovenian, and accusative indefinite pronouns in all the Slavic languages, so there is syntactic variation among such indefinites. In syntax, indefinite clitics stand for explicit arguments that are defective because they contain a human feature and no gender, number, or person, and move to repair deficiency. In semantics, they contain human variables and quantifiers reminiscent of some, which can be deleted by existential disclosure. When quantifiers are deleted and adverbs bind indefinite clitics, such clitics may resemble everyone, many people, and few people. In constructions with datives, Slavic clitics display a complex web of semantic and syntactic variation due to dative existential disclosure in logical form. Dative existential disclosure combines quantifier deletion with one of two operations binding datives to disclosed variables. In Polish and Slovenian, constructions with indefinite clitics and datives have the same syntax but differ in truth conditions because quantifiers are deleted, and datives bind disclosed variables in one way in Polish and another way in Slovenian. In Czech and Bulgarian, dative existential disclosure affects reflexive clitics standing for implicit arguments with different syntactic properties. Thus, there is syntactic variation, with Polish and Slovenian forming one syntactic group and Bulgarian and Czech another. Variation extends to semantics, because the meaning of constructions with reflexive clitics and datives is the same in Bulgarian and Slovenian, while Czech belongs to the same semantic group as Polish.},

The framework is intended to be coordinated with a dynamic compositional semantics. Accordingly, the context of utterance is modeled as a tuple of different types of information, and the questions therein --- modeled, as is usual in formal semantics, as alternative sets of propositions --- constrain the felicitous flow of discourse. A requirement of Relevance is satisfied by an utterance (whether an assertion, a question or a suggestion) iff it addresses the question under discussion. Finally, it is argued that the prosodic focus of an utterance canonically serves to reflect the question under discussion (at least in English), placing additional constraints on felicity in context.},

Heim's classic paper ``On the Projection Problem for Presuppositions'' (1983) proposed a replacement of truth-conditional semantics with a dynamic semantics that treats meanings as instructions to update the common ground. Heim's system predicts the basic pattern of presupposition projection quite accurately. The classic objection to this program (including other versions of dynamic semantics) is that the treatment of binary connectives is stipulative, and other, equally natural treatments fail to make the right predictions about presupposition projection. I give a variation on Heim's system that is designed to escape this objection. I show that the most liberal possible version of this variant is equivalent to a strong-Kleene system in terms of its definedness conditions.},

I argue that, as opposed to the summing peration involved in simple conjunction, there is a constraint on secondary predication; in the 0 case of depictives, the event introduced by the matrix verb must be PART-OF the event introduced by the secondary predicate, where e, is PART-OF e, if the running time of e, is contained in the running time of e" and if e, and e, share a grammatical argument. I argue resultative predication differs from depictive predication in that the PART-OF constraint holds in resultative constructions between the event which is the culmination of e, and e,: formally, while depictive predication introduces the statement PART-OF(e"e,), resultative predication introduces the statement PART-OF(cul(e,),e,). I show that this is all that is necessary to explain the well-known properties of resultative predication.},

  abstract = {The acquisition of reference involves both morphosyntax and pragmatics. This study investigates whether Dutch, English and French two- to three-year-old children differentiate in their use of determiners between non-specific/specific reference, newness/givenness in discourse and mutual/no mutual knowledge between interlocutors. A brief analysis of the input shows a clear association between form and function, although there are some language differences in this respect. As soon as determiner use can be statistically analyzed, the children show a relatively adult-like pattern of association for the distinctions of non-specific/specific and newness/givenness. The distinction between mutual/no mutual knowledge appears later. Reference involving no mutual knowledge is scarcely evidenced in the input and barely used by the children at this age. The development of associations is clearly related to the rate of determiner development, the French being quickest, then the English, then the Dutch.},

  abstract = {This study investigates the acquisition of pragmatic aspects of reference and its relationship to adult input. English two- to threeyear-old children were studied to determine whether they differentiate their use of determiners and pronouns with respect to the new/given distinction in discourse and the perspective of the listener (mutual knowledge vs. no mutual knowledge, physically present vs. physically absent). A sample of input language to the children was also analyzed for frequency and consistency with which determiners and pronouns were used in relation to these pragmatic conditions. Adult-like use of forms for new/given was reached by 2;9, development being quicker in determiners than pronouns. The sampled input reflected less consistency in pronoun use and can explain the slower development. In perspective-taking skills, the children have not reached an adult level in determiner use by 3;3. In determiner use, sensitivity to the listener's perspective develops more slowly than sensitivity to the new/given distinction. This can be related not only to the children's developing perspective-taking skills, but also to the input. The children receive little evidence for distinguishing mutual knowledge from no mutual knowledge. It is concluded that input frequency and consistency are relevant for the acquisition of new/given and listener's perspective in reference.},

Both age-groups performed significantly worse in the critical condition, which used familiar objects as props (e.g., small dogs as pretend hats) and required both implicit analogical reasoning and assigning second labels.

  abstract = {The inference from determinism to predictability, though intuitively plausible, needs to be qualified in an important respect. We need to distinguish between two different kinds of predictability. On the one hand, determinism implies external predictability, that is, the possibility for an external observer, not part of the universe, to predict, in principle, all future states of the universe. Yet, on the other hand, embedded predictability as the possibility for an embedded subsystem in the universe to make such predictions, does not obtain in a deterministic universe. By revitalizing an older result---the paradox of predictability---we demonstrate that, even in a deterministic universe, there are fundamental, non-epistemic limitations on the ability of one subsystem embedded in the universe to predict the future behaviour of other subsystems embedded in the same universe. As an explanation, we put forward the hypothesis that these limitations arise because the predictions themselves are physical events which are part of the law-like causal chain of events in the deterministic universe. While the limitations on embedded predictability cannot in any direct way show evidence of free human agency, we conjecture that, even in a deterministic universe, human agents have a take-it-or-leave-it control over revealed predictions of their future behaviour.},

It is argued that neither of these word orders reflects a word order that is expected on the basis of the syntactic structure alone. Instead, a unified explanation for these word orders is proposed, according to which they arise as the result of a lowering operation that applies at Phonological Form (PF) and is prosodically driven. Specifically, lowering applies in order to satisfy a prosodic-structure constraint, Weak Start, which requires elements that are relatively high on the prosodic hierarchy to be preceded by elements that are equal to or lower than them on the prosodic hierarchy. The word orders discussed herein therefore involve a mismatch between syntax and phonology, and lowering provides a means by which syntactic principles as well as principles relating to prosodic-structure can be simultaneously upheld.},

The Ezafe, a feature of certain Western Iranian languages, is realized as an enclitic and links the head noun to its modifiers and to the possessor NP. The latter follow the head and are linked to one another by the Ezafe. On the basis of crucial empirical facts that have never been discussed in previous studies, I argue that the Ezafe is best regarded as an affix attaching to nominal heads (nouns, adjectives and some prepositions), as well as to nominal intermediate projections, and marking them as expecting a modifier or a direct nominal complement. Viewed as such, the Ezafe construction is an instance of the head-marked pattern of morphological marking of grammatical relations. This analysis differs from all previous accounts of the Ezafe (i.e. as case-marker, syntactic or phonological linker) and entails that the Ezafe, which originated in the Old Iranian relative particle -               hya               , has undergone a process of reanalysis-grammaticalization, to end up as a part of nominal morphology.},

We propose an HPSG analysis to account for the morphosyntactic aspects of verbal suffixation of object clitics, possessive clitics, preverbal object clitics, and clitic doubling constructions. Finally, we explore extensions of the analysis to periphrastic verb forms, and we compare our proposals for Persian to previous HPSG work on clitic phenomena in other languages.},

All three phenomena (simple passive, subject raising, passive of ECM) turn out to obey a correlation called Burzio's generalization, according to which verbs that lack an agent argument also lack the ability to check case. We show further that there are two types of case, structural and inherent, and that Burzio's generalization holds only for structural case.

But this goal can be extended beyond language stricto sensu, to a variety of representational systems in nature. This was part of the program of semiotics (e.g. Morris 1938), construed as a general theory of signs; but it never got integrated to the research program of formal semantics. We argue for such an integration, on two general grounds. First, the class of objects that interact with or display uncontroversially linguistic properties is larger than was initially thought. Spoken and especially sign language make use of rich iconic resources which interact with logical structure but cannot be captured without a 'formal semantics with iconicity'. In addition, recent comparisons between sign, speech and gestures strongly suggest that language is multi-modal and that gestures are full citizens of the linguistic world: they trigger familiar inferential types (presuppositions or supplements) when they co-occur with or follow words; and when they fully replace words, their informational content gets divided among familiar slots of the inferential typology, and they even follow a 'gestural grammar' that is in part reminiscent of sign language grammar. Second, independently from these languageinternal motivations, the proposed extension leads to a far broader typology of meaning operations in nature, one that includes animal meanings, pictorial meanings, musical meanings, and more. This makes it possible to explore new connections among these domains, for instance between vocal and gestural iconicity, between musical inferences and animal signals, or between visual narratives and music.},

But none of these relations appears to hold on the surface; this is the 'connectivity problem'. Revisionists maintain that the problematic examples are identity sentences with no hidden structure, but that none of our c-command tests is infallible. Conservatives claim that our c-command tests are reliable, but that the clause John likes himself is indeed present at some level of representation. Siding with the Conservatives, we follow Ross's (1972) original insight and suggest that connectivity sentences equate a concealed question with an elided answer: [What John likes]= [John likes himself]. New arguments are given for each component of the analysis, and it is shown that connectivity effects are obviated when the elements that are equated are referential rather than clausal. The correct truth-conditions are derived from the semantics of identity, together with Groenendijk and Stokhof's (1990) semantics for questions. The analysis is then extended to cases of DP connectivity, such as His worry is himself, by suggesting that semantically dyadic nouns have an additional argument position, yielding the representation: [?x his [worry x]]=[his [worry himself]]. Finally, it is shown that recent objections based on `anti-connectivity' effects misfire, because the same facts hold of question-answer pairs, as is expected on the present approach.},

Chapter 1 defines the relevant output conditions for aspectual interpretation based on the semantic work of Verkuyl (1995) and Krifka (1989), and proposes a syntactic configuration within the Minimalist Program for Linguistic Theory (Chomsky 1993) at which aspect is calculated. Chapter 2 shows that two classic cases of apparent grammaticalization of aspect, Finnish and Slavic can be reduced to independently needed elements in the grammar: A-quantifiers and movement to AgrO for Case checking. Chapter 3 examines Accusative Clitic Doubling in Spanish and provides a new analysis which accounts for the aspectual interpretations of the construction. Chapter 4 proposes a theory of Determiner Transparency in which definite determiners in relative clauses, certain kinds of adjectives and demonstratives do not select for their head NP and as a result, durative reading of the VP predicate are obtained if the head is non-quantized. Chapter 5 extends the analysis to "type" expressions, measure phrases and possessives (genitives). Chapter 6 provides an aspectual analysis of the copula verbs 'ser' and 'estar' in Brazilian Portuguese, and argues against their being the grammaticalization of the stage-level and individual-level distinction.},

This is argued to involve predication, whereby a null pronoun serves as subject of the predication. Such predications occur at the left periphery of a variety of smaller phrases as well as at the sentential level. Primary evidence for predication involves the distribution of pronominal clitics in a variety of phrase types and the relation between genitive case and clitics. An anti-locality condition regulates the clitic's distribution with respect to predication. A predication approach to clitics reveals that clitics can play a role in (dependent) case assignment.},

  abstract = {We investigate the syntax and semantics of the sociative causative in Kinande (D42), a Bantu language spoken in eastern DRC. We present our discovery that Kinande, apparently unique among Bantu languages, grammaticalizes this type of causation with a specialized morpheme. In sociative causatives, the causer causes through social interaction rather than physical manipulation (direct causation) or words (indirect causation). We propose sociative causation in Kinande more exactly means `y carries out a subevent of P to help x do P.' Helping here is by doing and is not comitative: rather, it is partitive -- each actor does part of the action. This accounts for the classes of verbs that can undergo sociative causation. We establish that the construction is mono-clausal and note that the sociative morpheme is closely related to the benefactive applied morpheme. A second extension that occurs in this construction marks transitivity. We observe that the transitive extension can co-occur with the passive extension which tells us there is more than one voice projection in Kinande. Finally, we look more closely at the partitive reading of the caused event and note that the partitivity can be morpho-syntactically manifested either through partitive marking of the object of the caused event or through partitive marking of the caused event itself.},

  abstract = {This study examines the properties of VoiceP and impersonal pronouns by contrasting two constructions in Lithuanian: the -ma/-ta impersonal and the canonical passive. I argue that while both constructions overlap morphologically, they are syntactically distinct. The -ma/-ta impersonal is related to the Polish and Ukrainian -no/-to construction (e.g., Lavine 2005, 2013). Although the Lithuanian impersonal patterns with the Ukrainian -no/-to passive in allowing an auxiliary, it behaves like an active Voice with a null projected initiator in a thematic subject position - a pattern found in the Polish -no/-to impersonal and other impersonals crosslinguistically (Maling \& Sigurj{\'o}nsd{\'o}ttir 2002; Blevins 2003; Lavine 2005, 2013; McCloskey 2007; Legate 2014). I show that the Lithuanian passive lacks a syntactically realized initiator and selects for a type of Voice without a specifier (in line with e.g., Bruening 2013, Legate 2014, Alexiadou et al. 2015, contra Collins 2005). The properties of the impersonal pronoun of the -ma/-ta impersonal are also analyzed demonstrating that it is a bare N which lacks inherently specified {$\varphi$} -features (number, gender, and person) and has no case. This finding supports the existing proposals of impersonal pronouns across languages that treat them as defective (e.g., Egerland 2003b, Hoekstra 2010, Ackema \& Neeleman 2018, Fenger 2018, Legate et al. 2020).},

Evidence from Lithuanian demonstrates that ergativity and passive voice are not universal properties of CENs. First, Lithuanian CENs have two distinct structural genitive cases, a possessive genitive and a non-possessive genitive, which are analogous to a nominative-accusative case pattern found in active transitive constructions. Second, Lithuanian CENs are not passives: they have a syntactically projected external argument and a theme grammatical object with structural object case, namely the non-possessive genitive. I capture the Lithuanian pattern by extending a Voice-bundling approach (Pylkk{\"a}nen 2002, 2008; Harley 2017) to the nominal domain: CENs contain nvoiceactP, which performs the functions of both, a nominalizing n and an active thematic Voice bundled together. The nvoiceact head i) nominalizes the verbal structure, and ii) introduces an external argument as well as assigns structural object case to the theme. Overall, this study demonstrates that CENs can have the same transitive structure that can also be found in the verbal domain.},

Partitives are defined as constructions that may express the proportional relation of a subset to a superset (the true-partitive relation). First, it is demonstrated that, crosslinguistically, partitive constructions vary as to their syntactic properties and morphological marking. Syntactically, there is a cline from loose -- possibly less grammaticalized -- structures to partitives with rigid head-dependent relations and, finally, to morphologically integrated one-word partitives. Furthermore, partitives may be encoded NP-internally (mostly via an adposition) or pronominally. Morphologically, partitives primarily involve markers syncretic with separative, locative or possessive meanings. Finally, a number of languages employ no partitive marker at all. Secondly, these different strategies are not evenly distributed in the globe, with, for example, Eurasia being biased for the separative strategy. Thirdly, on the functional side, partitives may have functions in the following domains in addition to the true-partitive relation: plain quantification (pseudo-partitives), hypothetical events, predicate negation and aspectuality. I claim that the ability to encode plain quantification is the prerequisite for the other domains. Finally, it is argued that there is a universal preference towards syncretism of two semantically distinct concepts: the proportional, true-partitive relation (some of the books) and plain quantification (some books).},

I demonstrate that all the scope facts regarding negative sentences in Japanese can be accounted for if we assume obligatory object movement into the TP-domain in Japanese, that is, the difference between Japanese and English is not the structural position of negation but the existence of this obligatory object movement in Japanese. The analysis also involves a discussion of scopal properties of certain elements such as focused or disjunctive phrases, which play a crucial role to determine the position of objects. Then I argue that the obligatory object movement in Japanese is driven by the need for accusative Case-particle licensing, on the basis of the observation that objects without a Case-particle are generally immobile in Japanese. I show that this analysis leads to a new perspective on A-scrambling in Japanese.},

Despite the fact that the interpretation of Icelandic impersonal nullsubjects obeys restrictions similar to those observed for overt impersonal subject pronouns in various languages, they cannot be analyzed as lexical pronouns, deleted in PF. Rather, it is argued, impersonal null-subjects are constructed in syntax, by combination (merger) of abstract features. In general, it seems that pronouns, silent and overt, are PF representations of complex syntactic structures, rather than tokens for discrete terminal nodes. In addition, the paper discusses the cross-linguistic distribution and typology of impersonal null-subjects.},

We show that the complement of the causative verb must be at least as large as a VoiceP, and that it shares some properties with active VoicePs and others with passive VoicePs. We make sense of this state of affairs by proposing that the causee, while phonetically silent, has an explicit syntactic representation, but as a ␾P rather than a DP. We further propose that ICs are built by stacking a second VoiceP on top of the lexical verb's first VoiceP, and that this configuration, along with the underspecified interpretation of ␾P, leads to a special thematic interpretation of both the causer and the implicit causee. Our analysis suggests that there are certain core ingredients involved in building ICs---such as stacked VoicePs and an underspecified causee---but that the source of these ingredients can vary across languages and constructions, depending on the formal primitives that grammars make available to the languages more generally.},

  abstract = {We analyze genitive of negation (GN) in Lithuanian. When the verb is negated, GN is realized on an object that would otherwise be realized as accusative. We demonstrate that Lithuanian GN is a syntactic (in line with Arkadiev 2016) and morphological phenomenon in contrast to Russian GN, whose realization is influenced by semantic factors (e.g. Kagan 2013). It differs from Russian (Pesetsky 1982) in that (i) it is always assigned to a DP which would otherwise bear structural accusative regardless of its semantic properties, and (ii) it cannot affect a structural nominative DP regardless of whether it is an external or internal argument. Lithuanian GN, in this respect, is similar to Polish GN (e.g. Przepi{\'o}rkowski 2000, Witko{\'s} 2008). We offer a three-layered approach to case, arguing that GN is a reflection of structural object case, assigned in syntax, then translated to morphological genitive case at PF and, finally, realized at Vocabulary Insertion (Halle \& Marantz 1993). Thus, structural object case has two morphological realizations: as genitive under negation or as accusative in the absence of negation. Lithuanian also exhibits long-distance GN (Arkadiev 2016), showing that case boundaries can cross non-finite clauses without an overt CP element, suggesting these are not phases.},

  abstract = {Vietnamese is a language with a three-way split in the appearance of numeral classifiers when nouns are counted: some nouns always require classifiers (obligatory-classifier nouns), others occur only optionally with classifiers (optionalclassifier nouns), and a third group never combines with a classifier (non-classified nouns). This distribution provides potentially important information on the much debated question of whether classifiers functionally combine with numerals (Bale and Coon in Linguist Inq 45:695--707, 2014) or with nouns (Li in Linguist Inq 29 (4):693--702, 1998; Cheng and Sybesma in Linguist Inq 30:509--542, 1999). It also appears to challenge Chierchia's (Nat Lang Semant 6(4):339--405, 1998) characterization of the basic semantic type of nouns found in different languages, which assumes a uniform pattern of classifier occurrence in numeral classifier languages. Having described the broad distribution of classifiers in Vietnamese and the questions this raises, the article probes the syntactic properties of classifiers with the three types of noun in the language, considering double classifier patterns, fragment answers, passive constructions, and the use of classifiers with certain compound nouns. Evidence from such phenomena is shown to support the hypothesis that a uniform syntactic structure is actually projected with nouns of all types in Vietnamese, but sometimes masked by the use of nouns to overtly lexicalize both the N and CL positions in nominal projections through N-to-Cl movement.},

To remedy this, we introduce a Sentiment Treebank. It includes fine grained sentiment labels for 215,154 phrases in the parse trees of 11,855 sentences and presents new challenges for sentiment compositionality. To address them, we introduce the Recursive Neural Tensor Network. When trained on the new treebank, this model outperforms all previous methods on several metrics. It pushes the state of the art in single sentence positive/negative classification from 80\% up to 85.4\%. The accuracy of predicting fine-grained sentiment labels for all phrases reaches 80.7\%, an improvement of 9.7\% over bag of features baselines. Lastly, it is the only model that can accurately capture the effects of negation and its scope at various tree levels for both positive and negative phrases.},

I shall propose a format for the statement of rules (including so-called `conspiracies') which are `motivated' by the phonotactics in the sense of Matthews (1972: 219--220).

In the current study, we tested whether 17-month-old infants are able to track the status of a communicator's epistemic state and use this to infer what she intends to refer to. Our results show that manipulating whether or not a communicator has a false belief leads infants to different interpretations of the same communicative act, and demonstrate early mental state attribution in a pragmatic context.},

Where syntactic structure is explicitly modeled, prior work has relied predominantly on context-free grammars (CFGs), yet such formalisms are not sufficiently expressive for human languages. Combinatory categorial grammars (CCGs) are sufficiently expressive directly compositional models of grammar with flexible constituency that affords incremental interpretation. In this work, we evaluate whether a more expressive CCG provides a better model than a CFG for human neural signals collected with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while participants listen to an audiobook story. We further test between variants of CCG that differ in how they handle optional adjuncts. These evaluations are carried out against a baseline that includes estimates of next-word predictability from a transformer neural network language model. Such a comparison reveals unique contributions of CCG structure-building predominantly in the left posterior temporal lobe: CCG-derived measures offer a superior fit to neural signals compared to those derived from a CFG. These effects are spatially distinct from bilateral superior temporal effects that are unique to predictability. Neural effects for structure-building are thus separable from predictability during naturalistic listening, and those effects are best characterized by a grammar whose expressive power is motivated on independent linguistic grounds.},

  abstract = {This dissertation is a first look at English-speaking children's acquisition of the syntax of the partitive. It presents four experiments that contrast three types of structures and examines how they interact with adjectival modification: the partitive, the pseudopartitive and complex nouns with prepositional adjuncts. The experimentation investigates whether children recognize that the Determiner Phrase (DP) in the partitive is a barrier to adjectival modification. The partitive is contrasted with the pseudopartitive --a minimal pair structure that lacks an internal DP. The data shows that children under the age of six do not distinguish between the partitive and the pseudopartitive. They allow adjectives preceding the partitive to modify the second noun; this is standardly considered licit for the pseudopartitive structure, but not the partitive. This result is evidence that children are under-representing the syntax of the partitive and of DP. Syntactic representations of minimal DP and minimal partitive structures are suggested and it is argued that these structures may persist as an option in the adult grammar. Chapter 2 discusses multiple layers in DP, DP's status as a barrier/phase and how children acquire its syntax (Abney 1987, Cinque 1994, de Villiers \& Roeper 1995, Kupisch 2006, Bo{\v s}kovi{\'c} 2008). This chapter also includes evidence for an under- represented DP in the grammar of some adult English speakers (Schafer \& de Villiers 2000, Carlson et al 2006). Chapter 3 presents background literature on the syntax of the partitive (Jackendoff 1977, Hoeksema 1996), introduces the pseudopartitive structure (Selkirk 1977, Stickney 2004 and Alexiadou, Haegeman \& Stavrou 2007) and presents acquisition hypotheses. Chapters 4 \& 5 present a pilot experiment and three picture choice tasks. The experimental data shows that children and a subset of adults do not distinguish between partitive and pseudopartitive and yet they maintain a clear distinction between pseudopartitive and other similar complex nouns. Chapter 6 presents two syntactic analyses of the data. One uses a split-DP structure (Zamparelli 2000, Laenzlinger 2000) to explain the lack of barrier in children's partitives. The other suggests a reduced partitive structure (Rutkowski 2007). Both analyses require a reanalysis of the features of DP in children's partitives.},

  abstract = {Views differ radically as to how deep the roots of language lie in human phylogeny, largely because prior to the development of writing systems, this striking human attribute has to be inferred from indirect proxies preserved in the material record. Here I argue that the most appropriate such archaeological proxies encode the modern human symbolic cognitive system from which language emerges. Throughout the 2.5 million years or more for which an archaeological record has existed, change has been both sporadic and rare---until symbolic objects and behaviors begin to appear, well within the tenure of our highly apomorphic species Homo sapiens. I propose that the biology underwriting our unusual cognitive and linguistic systems was acquired in the major developmental reorganization that gave rise to our anatomically distinctive species around 200,000 years ago in Africa. However, the material record indicates that this new potential lay fallow for around 100,000 years, following which it was released by what was necessarily a behavioral stimulus. By far the best candidate for that stimulus is the spontaneous invention of language, which is plausibly underwritten by a relatively simple mental algorithm, and could readily have spurred symbolic cognitive processes in a feedback process. None of this means that earlier hominid vocal communication systems were not complex, or that extinct hominid species were not highly intelligent. But it does emphasize the qualitative distinctiveness of both modern symbolic cognition and language.},

Evidence is adduced from (i) the distribution of the copula in nominal and non-nominal predication sentences, which I show also suggests that the Mandarin copula has a predicate-creation function; and (ii) asymmetries in the interpretation of bare nouns and indefinite NPs in the subject and complement positions of shi.},

One property is that noun phrases are temporally interpreted at times that are contextually salient, such as utterance or topic times. Whether the denotation of the noun phrase is contextually established also influences its temporal interpretation. A comparison of the temporal interpretation of noun phrases and finite verbs reveals parallels (e.g., temporal anaphors play a role in both domains) as well as differences (e.g., in English, tense must constrain the temporal interpretation of finite verbs but not of noun phrases). Another property is that there is a rich array of temporal, aspectual, and modal expressions in the nominal domain, as in the verbal domain. A preliminary taxonomy of the meanings of these expressions is developed. A final property is that the meanings of nouns have implications for the temporal properties of the noun phrases in which they occur.},

  abstract = {Research on the acquisition of relevance implicatures usually shows that it is not until age six that children learn to draw relevance inferences. However, Schulze et al. (in press) demonstrated that the ability of children to comprehend implicatures might have been underestimated due to the relatively complex and metalinguistic nature of the tasks. When implicature generation is naturally embedded in an ongoing interaction and supported by joint attention, even three-year-olds appear to succeed. The present paper develops this research path and tests comprehension of relevance implicatures based on adjectives in two experiments in which implicature reading was a necessary step in a shopping game. Experiment 1 demonstrated that five-year-olds are adult-like in drawing relevance inferences from evaluative adjectives used in argumentative contexts. Three-year-olds, although having more difficulty with negative items, still performed above chance across all conditions. Experiment 2 extended this finding to even younger children (2;6-3;6) and revealed that the presence of joint attention helps toddlers to comprehend negative utterances. Children not supported by joint attention performed at chance with indirect negative utterances, whereas children in the joint-attention condition coped equally well with positive and negative trials.},

This volume provides accessible introductions to major topics and ongoing debates in event structure research, exploring what events are, how we perceive them, how we reason with them, and the role they play in the organization of grammar and discourse. The chapters are divided into four parts: the first covers metaphysical issues related to events; the second is concerned with the relationship between event structure and grammar; the third is a series of crosslinguistic case studies; and the fourth deals with links to cognitive science and artificial intelligence more broadly. 0The book is strongly interdisciplinary in nature, with insights from linguistics, philosophy, psychology, cognitive science, and computer science, and will appeal to a wide range of researchers and students from advanced undergraduate level upwards},

Task performance varied as a function of both word type and age group such that accuracy was greater for novel words than for foreign words, and task performance increased with age for both word types. For novel words, children in all age groups reliably chose the correct corresponding picture. For foreign words, 3year-olds showed chance performance, whereas 5- and 7-yearolds showed reliably above-chance performance. Results suggest increased sensitivity to sound symbolic cues with development and imply that although sensitivity to sound symbolism may be available early and facilitate children's word--referent mappings, sensitivity to subtler sound symbolic cues requires greater language experience.},

From the perspective of language, the question is how bilingualism might help or hinder cognition -- narrowly interpreted here as executive function. From the perspective of higher cognition, the question is what kinds of experiences improve executive function. Reported cognitive benefits from bilingualism range from none to substantial as a function of age, type of bilingualism (e.g., life-long balanced vs later-onset or infrequent use of the other language), syntactic relation between the two languages, socio-economic and immigrant status, task, and laboratory. To understand the variability and inconsistencies in results with bilingualism, I analyze concepts of executive function and cognitive reserve and examine the range of factors (such as active video game playing, education, musical training, and aerobic exercise) that are known to correlate with or to improve executive function. I suggest that a) ``executive function'' is a complex set of cognitive processes, the components of which are sometimes minimally correlated with each other, depending on the task; b) bilingualism is inconsistently correlated with superior executive function and delayed onset of dementia; c) all speakers (mono- or bilingual) have non-linguistic ways of improving executive function; and d) benefits from bilingualism -- and all cognitively challenging activities -- are inconsistent because individuals vary in the number and kinds of experiences they have that promote superior executive function.},

A challenge to this generalization arises in Spanish. In Spanish, in-situ full DP objects and postverbal object clitics conform to the established pattern of objects not being able to establish control into an adjunct. However, I present novel data showing that when an object clitic is preverbal, it can control the subject position of a non-finite temporal adjunct. Moreover, when a clitic can control into an adjunct, subject control is not ruled out; there can be ambiguity between the choice of controller. I show how this data can be accounted for following the two-tiered theory of control. I account for the optionality between a subject or preverbal clitic controller by distinguishing between two available positions for the clitic within vP.},

We show that Dinka provides strong support for the view that long-distance extraction proceeds through the edge of every verb phrase and every clause on the path of movement (Chomsky 1986, 2000, 2001, 2008). In addition, long-distance dependencies in Dinka offer evidence that extraction from a CP requires agreement between v and the CP that is extracted from (Rackowski and Richards 2005, Den Dikken 2009b, 2012a,b). The claim that both of these components constrain long-distance movement is important, as much contemporary work on extraction incorporates only one of them. To accommodate this conclusion, we propose a modification of Rackowski and Richards 2005, in which both intermediate movement and Agree relations between phase heads are necessary steps in establishing a long-distance dependency.},

  abstract = {Understanding the biological foundations of language is vital to gaining insight into how the capacity for language may have evolved in humans. Animal models can be exploited to learn about the biological underpinnings of shared human traits, and although no other animals display speech or language, a range of behaviors found throughout the animal kingdom are relevant to speech and spoken language. To date, such investigations have been dominated by studies of our closest primate relatives searching for shared traits, or more distantly related species that are sophisticated vocal communicators, like songbirds. Herein I make the case for turning our attention to the Chiropterans, to shed new light on the biological encoding and evolution of human languagerelevant traits. Bats employ complex vocalizations to facilitate navigation as well as social interactions, and are exquisitely tuned to acoustic information. Furthermore, bats display behaviors such as vocal learning and vocal turn-taking that are directly pertinent for human spoken language. Emerging technologies are now allowing the study of bat vocal communication, from the behavioral to the neurobiological and molecular level. Although it is clear that no single animal model can reflect the complexity of human language, by comparing such findings across diverse species we can identify the shared biological mechanisms likely to have influenced the evolution of human language.},

English TAC Tense is bound in Present adjuncts under matrix `will', in other constructions the TAC Tense is deictic. Tense licensing is non-local in bound constructions, while in deictic constructions it is local. 2. Russian TAC Tense is deictic, and the tense licensing is local. 3. Japanese TAC Tense is bound. We have a `tenseless' construction in the adjunct, and tense licensing is local.},

In Bambara, there are three affirmative non-verbal copulas used in different construction types, comprising one formal class. In Guinean Maninka, there is only one non-verbal affirmative copula, and it can be omitted; there is a tendency toward its substitution with a focalization particle. The affirmative non-verbal qualitative construction is copulaless. In both these languages, there is also a verbal copula used in non-default context, and an ostentative copula going back to a verb whose lexical meaning is `to look'. In Eastern Dan, copulas are diverse in nature: some are of verbal origin, while others go back to demonstrative adverbs. There are three series of inflectional auxiliary lexemes which are used both in verbal constructions and in constructions with non-verbal predicates, i.e. as copulas.},

New evidence from minimizer expressions and pseudopartitives, which have not been systematically investigated before, is brought to bear on details of the analysis. Japanese is an excellent testing ground for exploring the nature of the noun-related functional projections, because some of them, such as \#{$^\circ$} and Case{$^\circ$}, are argued to be overtly realized (\#{$^\circ$} as a classifier and Case{$^\circ$} as a case particle).},

One hypothesis is that since semantically incorporated nouns are not morphosyntactically incorporated in English, they can function like any other noun as prominent and accessible referents for anaphora. Another hypothesis is that their semantic status and their predicative meaning influence their discourse prominence, and hence their accessibility by anaphoric means. We tested these two hypotheses in two experimental studies on different anaphoric preferences of English pronouns. Our studies demonstrate that the felicity patterns for the two different pronominal reference strategies are determined at different linguistic levels: For it, we found an impact of morphosyntactic form; for that, the semantic type of the referent (object vs. event) seems to play a role.

  abstract = {Abstract             The work aims to bring a basic, but detailed description of Icelandic nominalizations to bear on the general theoretical and architectural issues that nominalizations have raised since the earliest work in generative syntax. While nominalization has long been central to theories of argument structure, and Icelandic has been an important language for the study of argument structure and syntax, Icelandic has not been brought into the general body of theoretical work on nominalization. This book shows that Icelandic-specific issues in the analysis of Derived Nominals have broad implications that go beyond the study of that one language. In particular, Icelandic provides special evidence that Complex Event Nominals (CENs), which seem to inherit their argument structure from the underlying verbs, can be formed without nominalizing a full verb phrase. This conclusion is at odds with prominent theories of nominalization which claim that CENs have the properties that they have precisely because they involve the nominalization of full verb phrases. The proposal in this book develops a theory of allosemy within the framework of Distributed Morphology, showing how one single syntactic structure can get distinct semantic interpretations corresponding to the range of readings that are available to Derived Nominals. The resulting proposal demonstrates how the study of Icelandic nominalizations can both further our understanding of argument structure and shed new light on the syntax-semantics interface.},

I address this question on the basis of comparative data from related Inuit languages, Inuktitut and Kalaallisut (West Greenlandic), and argue that both possibilities are attested in Inuit. Evidence for this claim comes from diverging syntactic and semantic properties of the object DPs encoded by this cross-referencing morphology. I demonstrate that object DPs in Inuktitut display various properties mirroring the behavior of clitic-doubled objects crosslinguistically, while their counterparts in Kalaallisut display none of these properties, indicating genuine ␾-agreement rather than clitic doubling. Crucially, this distinction cannot be detected morphologically, as the relevant crossreferencing morphemes are uniform across Inuit. Therefore, this article cautions against the reliability of canonical morphological diagnostics for (agreement) affixes vs. clitics.},

Our proposal involves the cyclical application of a phase-edge Person constraint, which ensures that a [+Participant] argument (when present) is promoted from the verbal (vP) to the inflectional (IP) domain. We illustrate the proposed analysis with Paraguayan Guaran{\'i}, a language with direct/inverse alignment whose morpho-syntax has received little attention from a formal perspective. Paraguayan Guaran{\'i} does not mark tense morphologically in Infl(ection); instead, the overt realization of Infl varies depending on the person specification of the arguments. We refer to languages of this type as Generalized P(erson)-languages, in contrast to Restricted P-languages, whose direct/inverse system is limited to the vP domain and whose Infl encodes tense (e.g., Hungarian and Kashmiri). Building on insights in Ritter and Wiltschko (2014) on the anchoring function of Infl, we link the distinction between the two types of language to the presence vs. absence of an interpretable tense feature and its complementary interpretable person feature in the Infl node of the clausal structure.},

In the formal semantics literature, opinion is divided between those who solve the puzzle by suggesting that progressive morphology creates an intensional context and those who rely on an extensional interpretation of the progressive.
